# Catch-phrases extraction from legal documents



1,2) Original Code Base:
    None. This is implemented from scratch (took  the help of Prof. Niranjan Balasubramanian's  dependancy parser assignment's template)


3) Commands to test and train:
    There are no commands. Use Jupyter ipython notebook to run below.

    Training the model:
        Use file train_tensor_impl.ipynb
        - Run all the cells present in above ipynb.
        NOTE: In case of some errors, restart your jupyter notebook kernel.

    Testing the model:
        Use file test_tensor_impl.ipynb
         - Run all the cells present in above ipynb. It should pick the savel model from MyModels directory
         - Last cell should output you the predictions
        NOTE: In case of some errors, restart your jupyter notebook kernel.


4) Software requirements:
    //enchant safe installation
