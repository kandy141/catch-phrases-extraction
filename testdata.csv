198,s191,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,30 Ordinarily that discretion will be exercised so that costs follow the event and are awarded on a party and party basis.
199,s192,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,A departure from normal practice to award indemnity costs requires some special or unusual feature in the case: Alpine Hardwood (Aust) Pty Ltd v Hardys Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 224 ; (2002) 190 ALR 121 at [11] (Weinberg J) citing Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 233 (Sheppard J).
200,s193,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,31 Order 23 provides for offers of compromise.
201,s194,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,In this case it was not suggested that the Sirtex offer complied with the requirements of O 23.
202,s195,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,In any event that Order is not a code.
203,s196,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,32 The general principles governing the exercise of the discretion to award indemnity costs after rejection by an unsuccessful party of a so called Calderbank letter were set out in the judgment of the Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386.
204,s197,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,In summary those principles are:  1.
205,s198,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"Mere refusal of a ""Calderbank offer"" does not itself warrant an order for indemnity costs."
206,s199,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"In this connection it may be noted that Jessup J in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 said that (at [6]):    if the rejection of such an offer is to ground a claim for indemnity costs, it must be by reason of some circumstance other than that the offer happened to comply with the Calderbank principle."
207,s200,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml, 2.
208,s201,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,To obtain an order for indemnity costs the offeror must show that the refusal to accept it was unreasonable.
209,s202,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,3.
210,s203,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,The reasonableness of the conduct of the offeree is to be viewed in the light of the circumstances that existed when the offer was rejected.
211,s204,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,33 The preceding general principles inform the exercise of the discretion.
212,s205,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,That discretion is not to be fettered by transformation of approaches and practices developed through the cases into quasi statutory rules.
213,s206,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"In John S Hayes amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 201 , Hill J said (at 203):  care must be taken not to circumscribe the discretion by reference to closed categories."
214,s207,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,It is not a necessary condition of the power to award costs that a collateral purpose be shown.
215,s208,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,The categories warranting the exercise of the discretion are not closed ... See also Goldberg J in Dr Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 602 at [15] .
216,s209,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,34 I accept that the making of a rolled up offer inclusive of costs and interest may detract from the weight to be given to its refusal in the exercise of the discretion.
217,s210,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,Finn J referred to authorities on the point in GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 ; (2003) 201 ALR 55 at [34] .
218,s211,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,His Honour cited single judge decisions to the effect that such offers ought not to be a relevant consideration on the question of costs and would not be considered in the same way as a Calderbank letter.
219,s212,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,His Honour was invited to depart from that line of first instance authority.
220,s213,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,However he was not prepared to say it was clearly wrong.
221,s214,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"Notwithstanding that, in the circumstances of the case he had to decide, his Honour found that:  The fact that the offer gave no indication at all of the breakdown ... between the claim, interest and costs blunts significantly the weight to be given the offer."
222,s215,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"35 While respecting the general approach to rolled up offers reflected in the cases to which Finn J referred, such approaches cannot be calcified into rules of law which fetter a general discretion."
223,s216,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,They simply reflect a common sense proposition that generally speaking such an offer is not unreasonably refused.
224,s217,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"There may, however, be circumstances where a rolled up offer, refused by an applicant who is unsuccessful, may support a claim for indemnity costs."
225,s218,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"36 On the question of the level of unreasonableness necessary to attract the discretion, I respectfully agree with the comment of Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [62] questioning the utility of substituting a requirement that rejection be ""plainly unreasonable"" for the requirement that it be ""unreasonable""."
226,s219,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"Given the evaluative character of the judgment involved the addition of the word ""plainly"" which is itself evaluative, has no useful function."
227,s220,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,37 At the time that Sirtex made its offer to UWA the prospect of UWA succeeding against Sirtex depended critically upon:  1.
228,s221,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"UWA establishing its case against Dr Gray and, in particular, that he had breached his fiduciary duty."
229,s222,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,2.
230,s223,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"UWA establishing that Sirtex was accessorially liable in relation to that breach, a position that depended upon establishing that Sirtex was aware of facts constituting (and which would have indicated to a reasonable person) the breach of fiduciary duties owed by Dr Gray to UWA."
231,s224,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,38 It cannot be said that UWA acted unreasonably in proceeding on the basis that it had a reasonable cause of action against Dr Gray.
232,s225,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,True it is that the case as framed and presented depended upon an important proposition of law as to the existence of an implied term in the contract of Dr Gray's employment with UWA.
233,s226,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,But the correctness of that proposition had not previously been tested in Australia in circumstances of the kind which arose in this case.
234,s227,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"This is not a case, in my opinion, in which it is appropriate to take a hindsight test to the facts known to UWA at the time of Sirtex's offer and conclude that it ought to have known that the law was against it."
235,s228,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,39 There were of course other hazards in the way of UWA's path to success against Dr Gray and therefore against Sirtex.
236,s229,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,The question whether the relevant inventions were made while Dr Gray was an employee of UWA was one issue upon which findings adverse to UWA were made on all but the DOX-Spheres technology.
237,s230,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"There was also a finding adverse to UWA that none of the Sirtex directors, apart from Dr Gray, were on notice of a potential claim."
238,s231,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,To establish any cause of action against Sirtex based on knowing involvement in his alleged breaches of fiduciary duty would have depended entirely upon his role as a director of Sirtex and whether his knowledge could be attributed to that company.
239,s232,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"In addition, UWA faced substantial defences by Sirtex based on UWA's delay in commencing proceedings after it first became aware of the facts relevant to its claimed causes of action."
240,s233,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,40 The preceding factors may be seen as weighing to some degree in favour of the Sirtex motion.
241,s234,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,On the other hand the offer came as the trial commenced.
242,s235,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"That is a factor, given the focus on the trial process which would then have existed, that militates against a finding of unreasonableness on the part of UWA in refusing the offer."
243,s236,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,That conclusion is not affected by the fact that Sirtex was making a counter-offer.
244,s237,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,The counter-offer was not a variation on a theme opened by UWA's offers.
245,s238,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,It was quite different and could have been proposed earlier.
246,s239,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,41 It is also relevant that the offer made no break-up between recovery and costs and interest.
247,s240,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,To that extent its refusal is less readily able to be characterised as unreasonable.
248,s241,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,42 UWA was entering into a complex piece of commercial litigation.
249,s242,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,The initial letter of demand to Sirtex indicated a level of confidence which was unrealistic given those complexities.
250,s243,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,But that unrealistic level of confidence does not mean that it did not have an arguable case.
251,s244,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,43 There is a mix of factors in this case which are related to the exercise of the discretion which Sirtex seeks to invoke.
252,s245,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,"Some point one way, some another."
253,s246,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,In the end I am not persuaded that the refusal of the Sirtex offer by UWA was so unreasonable in the circumstances that I ought to award indemnity costs against it.
254,s247,University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 (16 July 2008),08_1056.xml,The motion for indemnity costs will be dismissed.

8,s0,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml, INTRODUCTION  The applicant seeks review of the respondent's decision under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (ADJR Act).
9,s1,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"The decision in question is that of the respondent, an employee of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)."
10,s2,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The applicant has issued four other sets of proceedings against individual officers of the ATO.
11,s3,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The events with which each proceeding is concerned are related.
12,s4,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The reasoning on determination of each proceeding is also similar.
13,s5,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The respondent objects to the competency of the application on the basis that the decision the subject of the application was a decision making or forming part of the process of making assessments under the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) (GST Act) and is excluded by Sch 1 of the ADJR Act.
14,s6,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,GROUNDS OF REVIEW  The grounds upon which the applicant seeks review are numerous and reflect those appearing under s 5 of the ADJR Act.
15,s7,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"They are as follows:  (a) that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision; (b) that procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed; (c) that the decision was not authorized by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made; (d) that the making of the decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made; (e) that the decision involved an error of law, whether or not the error appears on the record of the decision; (f) that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision; (g) that the decision was otherwise contrary to law."
16,s8,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml," BACKGROUND  The applicant is the director, public officer and shareholder of the company Ivyside Pty Ltd (Ivyside)."
17,s9,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,Ivyside claimed GST input tax credits with respect to various purchases in relation to the company.
18,s10,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"On 22 May 2007, the respondent advised the applicant that the claims at 'label G11' on his activity statement for the period July to September 2006 would be disallowed because valid tax invoices were not produced to substantiate the amount of GST credits claimed."
19,s11,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The ATO subsequently issued the applicant notices pursuant to s 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (ITAA 1936) and s 353- 10 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (TAA).
20,s12,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"On or around 3 October 2007, the ATO issued the applicant an amended assessment and penalties for the July to September quarter of 2006."
21,s13,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"COMPLAINT  In this matter, the complaint raised is as to the disallowance of the GST entitlements for the July-September quarter of 2006 'such entitlements being bona fide ones that should be allowed'."
22,s14,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The applicant asserts that the decision of the respondent included 'purposeful mental and emotional pain and suffering the respondent is inflicting on the applicant; the applicant seeks relief from this harassment; oppression; and unlawful activities of the respondent'.
23,s15,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"However, in the affidavit in support of the application, the applicant clarifies that the decision of which he is seeking review was the decision by the respondent to deny and refuse him the right to an informal review of a GST issue relating to Ivyside."
24,s16,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,He stresses in his affidavit that it is not the original decision made by the respondent to disallow the GST entitlements but rather the decision to deny and refuse him an informal review.
25,s17,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,In support of that claim he annexes a document entitled 'Having your GST issue reviewed'.
26,s18,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"That document under the heading 'Informal Reviews' reads:  You can request an informal review of the GST decision we made or GST advice we provided, including private rulings."
27,s19,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Generally, an informal review is conducted by an officer who is not involved in the original decision."
28,s20,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"We will advise you of the outcome of the review, which could include changing the decision or advice, or confirming it."
29,s21,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"If you'd like to request an informal review, you should contact the person handling your case or the office where the decision was made."
30,s22,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml, The applicant also annexes a document apparently comprising a notification on behalf of Ivyside that it is seeking an order for review of the joint decision of the respondent and other officers of the ATO not to provide the company with an informal review of the audit which had been conducted.
31,s23,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,This communication was apparently sent by email on 2 January 2008.
32,s24,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The applicant also annexes a much earlier letter from the ATO (23 August 1999) in which an apology is extended for distress and inconvenience which had been caused to the applicant and his wife in previous dealings.
33,s25,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Assuming that the basis on which review is sought in this matter is a refusal to grant an informal review, the respondent complains that there is no evidence of a request for an informal review and there had been no agreement to conduct an informal review."
34,s26,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"More importantly, even if there had been such an agreement, a failure to do so would not constitute a decision as defined in s 3(1) and s 3(2) of the ADJR Act as no substantive rights would be affected by such a decision."

38,s30,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The filing of a notice of objection to competency also places the Court on notice that its jurisdiction to make the orders sought by the applicant in the proceeding is challenged.

52,s44,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"STATUTORY FRAMEWORK  Section 5 of the ADJR Act relevantly provides as follows:  5 Applications for review of decisions   (1) A person who is aggrieved by a decision to which this Act applies that is made after the commencement of this Act may apply to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court for an order of review in respect of the decision on any one or more of the following grounds: (a) that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision; (b) that procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed; (c) that the person who purported to make the decision did not have jurisdiction to make the decision; (d) that the decision was not authorized by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made; (e) that the making of the decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made; (f) that the decision involved an error of law, whether or not the error appears on the record of the decision; (g) that the decision was induced or affected by fraud; (h) that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision; (j) that the decision was otherwise contrary to law."
53,s45,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml, (2) The reference in paragraph (1)(e) to an improper exercise of a power shall be construed as including a reference to: (a) taking an irrelevant consideration into account in the exercise of a power; (b) failing to take a relevant consideration into account in the exercise of a power; (c) an exercise of a power for a purpose other than a purpose for which the power is conferred; (d) an exercise of a discretionary power in bad faith; (e) an exercise of a personal discretionary power at the direction or behest of another person; (f) an exercise of a discretionary power in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the particular case; (g) an exercise of a power that is so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have so exercised the power; (h) an exercise of a power in such a way that the result of the exercise of the power is uncertain; and (j) any other exercise of a power in a way that constitutes abuse of the power.
54,s46,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml," (3) The ground specified in paragraph (1)(h) shall not be taken to be made out unless: (a) the person who made the decision was required by law to reach that decision only if a particular matter was established, and there was no evidence or other material (including facts of which he or she was entitled to take notice) from which he or she could reasonably be satisfied that the matter was established; or (b) the person who made the decision based the decision on the existence of a particular fact, and that fact did not exist."
55,s47,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Relevantly, s 3 of the ADJR Act identifies the decisions to which the Act applies as a 'decision of an administrative character made, proposed to be made, or required to be made (whether in the exercise of a discretion or not and whether before or after the commencement of this definition)':  (a) under an enactment referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of the definition of enactment; or (b) by a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth under an enactment referred to in paragraph (ca) or (cb) of the definition of enactment; other than: (c) a decision by the Governor-General; or (d) a decision included in any of the classes of decisions set out in Schedule 1."
56,s48,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml, By s 3(d) the definition of 'decision to which this Act applies' is narrowed by the exclusion of decisions included in any of the class of decisions set out in Sch 1.
57,s49,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Schedule 1 of the ADJR Act relevantly provides:  Schedule 1---Classes of decisions that are not decisions to which this Act applies  ...

60,s52,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,Accordingly the substituted ground of the alleged refusal to conduct an informal review would not be a 'decision' at all.
61,s53,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The Applicant The applicant asserts that the Court does have jurisdiction to hear the matter.
62,s54,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,He contends that the respondent's decision or conduct is reviewable in this Court and it falls within the class of decisions to which the ADJR Act applies.
63,s55,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"RELEVANT PRINCIPLES  Pursuant to s 8 of the ADJR Act, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine applications made under the ADJR Act."
64,s56,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,Section 5 of the ADJR Act provides that a person aggrieved by a decision to which the Act applies may apply to the Court for an order of review on certain grounds.
65,s57,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Section 6 of the ADJR Act provides for review of conduct, engaged in, being engaged in or proposed to be engaged in for the purpose of making a decision to which the ADJR Act applies."
66,s58,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"It is apparent from the definition of 'decision to which this Act applies' in s 3 of the ADJR Act that the Act only applies where there is a making of, proposal to make or requirement to make a decision, the decision is of an administrative character, and the decision is made under an enactment."
67,s59,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 (at 335), Mason CJ discussed the meaning of 'decision' under s 3 of the ADJR Act and held (relevantly) (citations omitted):  (1) Meaning of ""Decision""   The definition in s.3(1) does not elucidate significantly the meaning of the word ""decision"" as it is used in the A.D.(J.R.) Act."
68,s60,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"It is clear that a ""decision to which this Act applies"" must be a decision of an administrative character, that it may be made in the exercise of a discretion, and that it must be made under an enactment."
69,s61,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"But these characteristics provide little guidance as to the meaning of the word ""decision"" upon which the definition in s.3(1) is based."
70,s62,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,  ...   Nonetheless other considerations point to the word having a relatively limited field of operation .
71,s63,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"First, the reference in the definition in s.3(1) to ""a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment"" indicates that a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorizes rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision."
72,s64,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Secondly, the examples of decision listed in the extended definition contained in s.3(2) are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute or, in the words of Deane J., ""a determination effectively resolving an actual substantive issue ""."
73,s65,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Thirdly, s.3(3), in extending the concept of ""decision"" to include ""the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power"", to that extent qualifies the characteristic of finality."
74,s66,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Such a provision would have been unnecessary had the Parliament intended that ""decision"" comprehend every decision, or every substantive decision, made in the course of reaching a conclusive determination."
75,s67,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Finally, s.3(5) suggests that acts done preparatory to the making of a ""decision"" are not to be regarded as constituting ""decisions"" for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of ""conduct"" as well as of a ""decision ""."
76,s68,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,  The relevant policy considerations are competing.
77,s69,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"On the one hand, the purposes of the A.D.(J.R.) Act are to allow persons aggrieved by the administrative decision-making processes of government a convenient and effective means of redress and to enhance those processes."
78,s70,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"On the other hand, in so far as the ambit of the concept of ""decision"" is extended, there is a greater risk that the efficient administration of government will be impaired."
79,s71,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Although Bowen C.J. and Lockhart J. appeared to emphasize the first of these considerations in Australian National University v. Burns , there comes a point when the second must prevail, as their Honours implicitly acknowledged."
80,s72,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"To interpret ""decision"" in a way that would involve a departure from the quality of finality would lead to a fragmentation of the processes of administrative decision-making and set at risk the efficiency of the administrative process."
81,s73,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,  ...   Another essential quality of a reviewable decision is that it be a substantive determination .
82,s74,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"With the exception of s.3(2)(g), the instances of decision mentioned in s.3(2) are all substantive in character."
83,s75,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Moreover, the provisions in sub-ss."
84,s76,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"(1), (2), (3) and (5) of s.3 point to a substantive determination."
85,s77,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"In this context the reference in s.3(2)(g) to ""doing or refusing to do any other act or thing "" (emphasis added) should be read as referring to the exercise or refusal to exercise a substantive power."
86,s78,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,I do not perceive in s.16(1)(b) or in par.
87,s79,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,(e) of Sched.1 or par.
88,s80,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,(a) of Sched.2 to the A.D.(J.R.) Act any contrary implication.
89,s81,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,These exclusions from the A.D.(J.R.) Act or from s.13 appear to have been introduced for more abundant caution and it would be unwise to take too much from them.
90,s82,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"(emphasis added)  Despite the clarity of the passage from the learned Chief Justice, application of the principles has not been without difficulty."
91,s83,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Views on whether or not particular decisions or conduct constitutes a reviewable decision have not always been unanimous (for example, Guss v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 88 ; (2006) 152 FCR 88)."
92,s84,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,Not only are there questions as to whether conduct constitutes a decision but also whether it is a decision taken under an enactment.
93,s85,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"For a decision to be reviewable it must be one 'for which provision is made by or under a statute', the provision should be more specific than general (for example, Hutchins v Commissioner of Taxationn (1996) 65 FCR 269 and Electricity Supply Assn of Australia Ltd v Australian Competition amp; Consumer Commission [2001] FCA 1296 ; (2001) 113 FCR 230)."
94,s86,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,A general authorisation for a body to act in a certain way is not usually regarded as being sufficient to qualify a decision as being one made under an enactment: Salerno v National Crime Authority (1997) 75 FCR 133.
95,s87,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Dealing with the enactment aspect, the majority of the High Court in Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 held (at [89]) that:  The determination of whether a decision is ""made ... under an enactment"" involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment."
96,s88,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"A decision will only be ""made ... under an enactment"" if both these criteria are met."
97,s89,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise."
98,s90,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question."
99,s91,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice.
100,s92,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml," Indeed the High Court went on to observe that even though a decision taken may have a critical effect for the operation of the federal statute, if it is a decision made 'dehors' the federal statute, it would be un-reviewable."
101,s93,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"CONSIDERATION  In the present circumstances, although the decision of which complaint was originally made was carried out pursuant to statutory power, it does not constitute, in my view, a decision in the sense contemplated in s 3 of the ADJR Act or as explained by the Chief Justice in Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; 170 CLR 321."
102,s94,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,Nor does the alleged refusal to informally review.
103,s95,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,In the language of Fox ACJ in Evans v Friemann (1981) 35 ALR 428 at 431 the relevant decision or conduct did not constitute a decision which was final and conclusive for immediate purposes at least.
104,s96,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"It was not the ultimate or operative determination of an issue as distinct from the determination of issues arising in the course of making such an ultimate decision ( Social Services, Director-General of v Chaney [1980] FCA 87 ; (1980) 31 ALR 571)."
105,s97,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"The best guidance for this is the clear language of Mason CJ in Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; 170 CLR 321 that the decision will generally but not always entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense and a conclusion reached that is a step along the way in the course of reasoning leading to an ultimate decision would not ordinarily amount to a reviewable decision unless the statute provided for the making of a finding or ruling on that point so that the decision, though an indeterminate decision, might accurately be described as a decision under an enactment."
106,s98,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"When it comes to the consideration of policy, the competing policies on the one hand of permitting aggrieved persons to challenge administrative decisions and on the other, enabling efficient administration of government processes provides some guidance."
107,s99,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"If the legislation has provided other means of challenging decisions rather than judicial review under the ADJR Act, at least insofar as policy is concerned, availability of a right of challenge is not withheld."
108,s100,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,In Century Yuasa Batteries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 73 FCR 528 it was held that the Commissioner's decision to seek to recover an amount equal to withholding tax and penalty for late payment due by the applicant and the demand for payment of those sums was not reviewable because it did not constitute a substantive determination.
109,s101,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,This was because it lacked the necessary element of finality as liability for payment of those sums arose from the operation of the ITAA 1936 and not in consequence of any reviewable decision of the Commissioner.
110,s102,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,His Honour said (at 540-541):  Section 221YR(1) (the Commissioner's power to sue for the money as a debt due to the Commonwealth) and s 8 (the Commissioner's power of general administration of the ITAA) do not of themselves give force or effect to the decision to demand payment of a sum of money which the Commissioner claims is payable under the ITAA and as such it is not a decision made under an enactment ( Hutchins v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 65 FCR 269 at 273 per Black CJ and at 278-279 per Spender J).
111,s103,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"  Even if the view of Lockhart J in Hutchins v Commissioner of Taxation is adopted, namely that the power of the Commissioner to sue for the recovery of the amount due as a debt to the Commonwealth authorises the Commissioner to do all things reasonably necessary to recover the amount and thereby characterises the demand as a decision of an administrative character made under an enactment (at 276-277), that does not of itself make the demand a reviewable decision."
112,s104,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"The decision to seek to recover an amount equal to the withholding tax and penalty for late payment from the applicant, and the demand for payment of the same within 14 days, is not a substantive determination."
113,s105,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,It determines nothing.
114,s106,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"As such the decision lacks a necessary characteristic of a reviewable decision ( Bond at 337; Hutchins at 274, 277)."

116,s108,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"If the demand is not met by the applicant because of an erroneous view that it is not liable to make the payment, any liability for additional tax for late payment arises from the operation of the ITAA and not in consequence of any reviewable decision of the Commissioner."
117,s109,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml," And as held in Ruddy v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 82 FCR 337 , the decision to sue for recovery was not a decision on an important substantive issue which was the essence of an ultimate decision which would have far-reaching consequences."
118,s110,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,It is not final or determinative because it does not remove a benefit or expose an applicant to detriment to which it is not already subject.

121,s113,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"In relation to the alternative ground advanced for the respondent, it is contended that what is sought is a review of the decision which formed part of the process of making or refusing to amend the calculation of tax under the GST Act and as such, it is a decision not capable of review under the ADJR Act being excluded by the provisions of Sch 1(e)."
122,s114,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"The respondent contends that to the extent reliance is placed on the decision of the disallowance of claimed GST input credits, any decision taken in that regard (by the Commissioner rather than the respondent) would fall within the exclusion provisions due to the course of dealings between the parties) ( Bennett Honda Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1984] FCA 414 ; (1984) 4 FCR 99 per Morling J)."
123,s115,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The respondent stresses that Ivyside (as distinct from the applicant) has appellate procedures available to it in respect of the decision made by or on behalf of the Commissioner to disallow GST input tax credits claimed.
124,s116,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,It is for that reason that all components of the decisions by the officers of the ATO charged with making that decision are not susceptible to review under the ADJR Act as they fall within the parameters of par e to Sch 1.
125,s117,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,CONCLUSION  The original complaint was the purported infliction of pain on the applicant by disallowing GST entitlements.
126,s118,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The revised complaint is as to the refusal of the internal review to discuss the issue.
127,s119,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"In my view, the alleged actions or conduct of which complaint has been raised by the applicant did not constitute a decision of a reviewable nature within the meaning of the ADJR Act and the authorities."
128,s120,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,There was no substantive determination.
129,s121,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"There was no decision having the character or quality of finality and the actions taken, even accepting for purposes that they had the quality asserted by the applicant, simply formed part of a process of leading up to the making of a decision by the Commissioner to disallow the claimed GST input credits claimed by Ivyside."
130,s122,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,It was not a decision which affected in any way or in any direct sense the applicant's legal rights and obligations.
131,s123,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"Further and as a distinct ground, even if there were an appropriate basis for review, it could be advanced only by the company, Ivyside not by the applicant."
132,s124,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"However, if this were the only issue standing in the way of the competency of this application, I may have granted any application to amend the identity of the applicant, or for that matter, the respondent."
133,s125,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,"The difficulty with the competency of the application however, in my view, is much more fundamental, going to jurisdiction."
134,s126,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The respondent's jurisdictional objection to competency must be upheld and the claim dismissed.
135,s127,Parker v Parker [2009] FCA 930 (25 August 2009),09_930.xml,The applicant is to pay the costs of the respondent to be taxed if not agreed.

163,s156,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"CERVARIX, on the other hand, is described as having been formulated using ""next generation vaccine technology (adjuvant AS04)"" which ""induces a stronger immune response than the same vaccine formulated in the traditional way with an aluminium way with an aluminium adjuvant""."

165,s158,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"The use of terms such as ""next generation"" in contrast to ""traditional way"" was calculated to leave doctors in no doubt as to the greater strength and longer lasting immune response of CERVARIX in comparison to GARDASIL."
166,s159,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"In addition, the GSKA Information Sheet refers to a study by ""Giannini, 2005"" in support of its claim regarding the superiority of its adjuvant."
167,s160,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,The plain implication of all this is said to be that CERVARIX provides longer protection than GARDASIL.
168,s161,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,47 CSL contends that the comparative statements regarding the adjuvants used in each product are misleading because the aluminium adjuvant used in GARDASIL is quite different to what is commonly regarded as the traditional aluminium adjuvant reported in the Giannini paper.
169,s162,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"Without going too deeply into scientific issues, CSL says that the adjuvant used in the Giannini study was aluminium hydroxide."

172,s165,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,It is sufficient simply to say that there are conflicting views about the accuracy of the representation contained in paragraph 10(i) of the Statement of Claim.
173,s166,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,That means there is a serious question to be tried regarding this issue.

181,s174,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,That fact is important both clinically and commercially because HPV infects both males and females.

191,s184,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,  56 It is often said that where an interlocutory injunction is sought an applicant must prove that it is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy.

193,s186,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,It is further suggested that injunctions in the common law jurisdiction need not be saddled with this requirement.
194,s187,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"57 There has been some debate among commentators as to whether an applicant for an interlocutory injunction is required to establish not merely that there is a serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience favours the grant of such relief, the two conditions that are universally accepted, but also that, without an injunction, he or she will suffer injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation."
195,s188,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"In other words, the question is whether an applicant must overcome three separate hurdles rather than two."

200,s193,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,60 GSKA submitted that CSL had not shown that it would suffer injury for which damages would not be an adequate remedy if interlocutory relief were refused.

209,s202,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,63 According to CSL this meant that there was an unacceptable risk that GSKA would continue to engage in direct comparisons between GARDASIL and CERVARIX which involved representations which were wrong and not supported by scientific evidence.
210,s203,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,CSL had requested GSKA to desist from the conduct in relation to which CSL complained.

217,s210,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"66 Put simply, Dr Anderson claimed that the GSKA Information Sheet, and follow-up interviews, represented CERVARIX was superior to GARDASIL, and did so in a manner that was misleading or deceptive."
218,s211,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"He said that, based upon his experience of the conduct of genuine market research, and the numerous errors in the information distributed by GSKA, he considered that GSKA had attempted to create ""fear, uncertainty and doubt"" about GARDASIL in order to reduce market confidence in that product."
219,s212,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"He said that this was a well-known marketing tactic known as ""FUD""."

225,s218,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,He said the misleading information could also influence federal cabinet to delay funding of GARDASIL until CERVARIX became available if they believed GSKA's claims that CERVARIX might be a better vaccine.
226,s219,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"He said that he was also concerned that State and Territory decision-makers, with inadequate scientific knowledge or experience, might be influenced in relation to the assessment of tenders by the dissemination of such information."
227,s220,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,69 Dr Anderson said that it was highly likely that misinformation of this nature could spread rapidly within the medical community.
228,s221,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,He noted that the issue had also received substantial media coverage as a result of the GARDASIL launch activities and the high profile of Professor Frazer's work.
229,s222,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,He said that he believed that the only way the damage being suffered by CSL could be reduced is if GSKA were immediately restrained from repeating the representations that are the subject of this proceeding.

232,s225,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,He gave some examples of this.
233,s226,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"71 Mr Herd replied by noting firstly that GSKA had, since March 2006, been engaged in dealing with the TGA in support of its application for registration of CERVARIX."
234,s227,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,He understood that that application would be reviewed at a meeting of the ADEC in the first half of 2007.
235,s228,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,72 Mr Herd said that he was responsible for developing GSKA's reimbursement strategy for submission to the PBAC.
236,s229,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,He rejected Dr Anderson's claim that the PBAC would be influenced by representations of the kind contained in the GSKA Information Sheet.
237,s230,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"He noted the PBAC was an independent body set up by statute, and that its members included medical practitioners and pharmacists."

239,s232,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,He noted that it was recognised within the pharmaceutical industry that it was improper for pharmaceutical companies to approach individual members of the PBAC and its various sub-committees to seek to influence its decision making process with regard to specific applications.
240,s233,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,He said that GSKA was careful to ensure that it complied strictly with these guidelines when making any application to the PBAC.

244,s237,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,74 Mr Herd said that GSKA would itself suffer irreparable harm if interlocutory relief were granted to CSL.
245,s238,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,He emphasised the need for GSKA to be able to communicate with the TGA fully regarding CERVARIX while the review process was being conducted.
246,s239,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"He noted that if the TGA came to the view that there were significant clinical advantages offered by CERVARIX, compared to GARDASIL, GSKA would be inhibited in being able to communicate or otherwise discuss such matters."
247,s240,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"These would delay GSKA's ability to apply for public funding of CERVARIX through the NIP, and its ability to supply CERVARIX to that section of the Australian population for which the TGA might decide to indicate the product."
248,s241,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"In particular, if the data submitted by GSKA to the TGA were accepted, Australian women over 26 years of age would be denied the opportunity to obtain access to CERVARIX."
249,s242,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,GARDASIL would be unavailable to this section of the population as it was only indicated for women aged 9 to 26 years.
250,s243,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml, Balance of convenience --- the contentions   75 CSL contended that the harm that it would suffer if GSKA's conduct was not restrained fell into three categories.
251,s244,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"76 First, its marketing launch of GARDASIL is being, and would continue to be, substantially disrupted."
252,s245,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"GSKA's conduct was said to be diluting CSL's marketing advantage arising out of the ""head start"" it had achieved through being the first to market its unique vaccine."
253,s246,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,CSL claimed that it was being forced to divert its sales resources in order to correct the misinformation being disseminated by GSKA.
254,s247,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"77 Second, CSL would lose sales of GARDASIL that would otherwise be made as general practitioners put off their decision to prescribe vaccine until CERVARIX came onto the market."
255,s248,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"In that context it was important to remember that these products were vaccines, and not treatments for existing illnesses."
256,s249,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"According to CSL it would be impossible to tell whether sales which had been lost or postponed were lost or postponed as a result of GSKA's representations, or for other reasons."
257,s250,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"78 Third, there was a risk that tender coordinators, who would be responsible for very large orders if a public immunisation program were implemented, would be unfairly prejudiced against GARDASIL on the basis of inaccurate or incomplete information."
258,s251,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"CSL argued that the tender coordinators, their public servant assistants and the members of any purchasing boards would not be well placed to analyse detailed scientific submissions."
259,s252,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,Many of them may not even be medically qualified.
260,s253,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,79 According to CSL the damage that it would suffer from each of these types of harm would not be calculable.
261,s254,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,Such irreparable harm would be suffered even if the time between the hearing of this interlocutory application and the final trial were truncated.
262,s255,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"CSL noted that apart from the 300 or so general practitioners who had participated in the ""market research project"" there were approximately 18,000 general practitioners in Australia of whom 12,000 or so actively worked in clinical practice."
263,s256,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,Misinformation of the kind sought to be enjoined was likely to spread quickly within the medical community.
264,s257,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"80 CSL argued that there would be no harm to GSKA if it were restrained until trial from making any representation in Australia that CERVARIX offered or possessed cross-protection against cervical cancer, or that it was more effective and offered longer protection than GARDASIL."
265,s258,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"That was because until such time as the TGA approved the marketing of CERVARIX, GSKA could not sell or supply its product."
266,s259,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"In any event, GSKA was free to legitimately ""market"" CERVARIX in Australia."
267,s260,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,CSL sought only to restrain GSKA from unfairly and inaccurately comparing CERVARIX to GARDASIL.
268,s261,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,81 CSL expressly disavowed any intention of restraining GSKA from communicating with the TGA about CERVARIX in relation to matters that might arise during the prosecution of GSKA's application for marketing approval.
269,s262,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"82 GSKA noted that the undertakings sought by CSL, in place of those proffered by GSKA, were in far broader terms even than the interlocutory and final relief sought in CSL's application."
270,s263,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"GSKA noted that the ""market research project"" about which CSL complained had been completed by mid-July 2006."
271,s264,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"It submitted that it was highly unlikely that the GSKA Information Sheet had been retained, or disseminated by the general practitioners to whom it was provided."
272,s265,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"Moreover, GSKA had undertaken, until trial or further order, not to further distribute the GSKA Information Sheet."
273,s266,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,83 GSKA submitted that interlocutory relief should be refused by reason of delay.
274,s267,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,It noted that a period of 10 weeks had elapsed from the time that CSL first learned of the GSKA conduct of which it now complained until it commenced this proceeding.
275,s268,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,84 GSKA next submitted that it was an important factor when considering the balance of convenience that the trial of this matter could be heard within a very short time.
276,s269,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"In fact, the Court indicated that the application for final relief could be heard in mid-November 2006, a delay of less than two months."
277,s270,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"According to GSKA, the fact that a speedy trial could be held meant that there was less justification for the grant of interlocutory relief."
278,s271,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,85 GSKA further submitted that CSL had grossly overstated the damage that it claimed it would suffer if no interlocutory relief were granted.
279,s272,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"CSL's assertion that its sales force was ""not able to function optimally or effectively"" in the absence of injunctive relief was not supported by the evidence."
280,s273,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,Only a handful of CSL sales representatives engaged in promoting GARDASIL had had any contact with doctors who had spoken to GSKA representatives about CERVARIX.
281,s274,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,There was nothing to suggest that any irreparable harm had been done by anything said to any doctor by a GSKA representative.
282,s275,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,86 GSKA challenged CSL's contention that the members of the PBAC were likely to be swayed in their decision whether to recommend the inclusion of GARDASIL in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by a two page information sheet used in a telephone survey of general practitioners.
283,s276,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,The same was said to apply to members of the State tender bodies for the NIP.
284,s277,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,87 GSKA also noted that CSL had engaged in a massive marketing campaign in relation to GARDASIL.
285,s278,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"This included two separate mail-outs to almost 20,000 general practitioners in Australia, advertisements in various journals, presentations at conferences and press releases."
286,s279,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"It submitted that it was inconceivable that a publicity exercise of this magnitude could be irreparably harmed in the few weeks prior to the trial of this matter given the cessation of the conduct complained of, and the negligible evidence of short-term harm that CSL had provided."
287,s280,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"88 Finally, GSKA contended that it would suffer significant and irreparable harm if it were restrained from carrying out the preparatory work leading up to the marketing of CERVARIX pending the trial of this matter."
288,s281,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,It submitted that both CSL and GSKA engaged in extensive activities gearing up to the approval and launch of a new drug product.
289,s282,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"These included corresponding with various regulatory bodies, such as the TGA, the PBAC and various State tender bodies for immunisation programs, attending conferences and symposia, preparing for distribution post-approval educational material, and responding to inquiries from interested persons."
290,s283,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,89 GSKA noted that its application for registration for CERVARIX was currently before the TGA.
291,s284,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"Following the extensive publicity that had been given to GARDASIL since its launch, GSKA had received a number of queries regarding CERVARIX."
292,s285,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,It had representatives attending three medical conferences in the period between mid-October and mid-November 2006.
293,s286,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"90 According to GSKA, if it were prevented from discussing the characteristics and attributes of CERVARIX it would be unable to:   #8226; communicate with the TGA about its application for the registration of CERVARIX; #8226; participate in scientific debate or engage in meaningful discussions with attendees at any of the three upcoming medical conferences; #8226; communicate with the PBAC or State tender bodies; or #8226; respond to queries from interested persons."
294,s287,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"  91 GSKA submitted that its inability to do any of the above would severely hamper it in its preparation for the launch of CERVARIX in Australia and place it at a disadvantage to CSL in the Australian HPV vaccine market, over and above that which it already faced simply by being second to market."
295,s288,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"It submitted that CSL, by bringing this proceeding, was seeking to secure a monopoly in Australia for the supply and sale of GARDASIL to which it was not entitled by excluding GSKA from the relevant market for as long as possible."
296,s289,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"It submitted that in circumstances where it had proffered undertakings and agreed to a speedy trial and where there was no evidence of any real irreparable harm to CSL, the balance of convenience favoured the refusal of interlocutory relief."
297,s290,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml, Conclusion   92 The interlocutory relief sought by CSL is in the nature of a quia timet injunction.
298,s291,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"That is, what CSL seeks is an injunction to prevent or restrain an apprehended or threatened wrong which would result in substantial damage if committed."
299,s292,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"93 In quia timet proceedings, the court will have regard to the degree of probability of the apprehended injury, the degree of the seriousness of the injury, and the requirements of justice between the parties."
300,s293,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"In R v McFarlane; Ex parte O'Flannagan and O'Kelly [1923] HCA 39 ; (1923) 32 CLR 518 Isaacs J observed (at 539):   ""The Court is not entitled to apply the obstacle of injunction to the contemplated action of a co-ordinate branch of the Government unless not only a clear case of illegality, proved to be calculated to result in a clear injury, is established, but also it is shown that by no other means can injury be averted or sufficiently compensated for."
301,s294,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"""    94 Dr I C F Spry, in Equitable Remedies (2001, 6 th ed), comments (at 378) that quia timet injunctions are not granted unless the imminence of the act to be prohibited is sufficiently clearly established to justify the court's intervention."
302,s295,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"The fact that there is no breach presently occurring may make it more difficult, as a matter of evidence, to establish that there is a sufficient risk of a future injury to justify the immediate grant of an injunction."
303,s296,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"If, in all the circumstances, the likelihood that an injury will take place is not sufficiently high, quia timet relief will be refused."
304,s297,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"The applicant will be left either to avail him or herself of such other remedies as may be open, or else to renew his or her application should the likelihood of an injury subsequently increase sufficiently to render equitable intervention appropriate."
305,s298,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,95 There is some debate as to whether a greater degree of proof is required in a case involving interlocutory quia timet relief than in a case involving a different kind of injunction.
306,s299,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"The issue is discussed in Meagher, Gummow amp; Lehane (at [21-395]), and need not be further canvassed here."
307,s300,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"It is sufficient to note that, in many cases, it may be more difficult to prove that an apprehended injury will occur than it is to prove that an existing injury will continue."
308,s301,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"96 I have already indicated that I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried in relation to representations 10(a), (d), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) as pleaded in CSL's Statement of Claim."
309,s302,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,The allegations relating to some of those representations appear to me to be stronger than those relating to others.
310,s303,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"However, nothing of any consequence turns upon this for the purposes of this interlocutory application."
311,s304,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"97 I am prepared to proceed upon the basis that CSL will suffer some harm if these representations, assuming they are false, are repeated between now and mid-November, when the final hearing of this matter will take place."
312,s305,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"It may be, as CSL contends, that damages will not be an adequate remedy for such harm."
313,s306,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,That means that CSL has overcome the first two hurdles that it must meet in order to obtain the interlocutory relief that it seeks.
314,s307,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"98 However, CSL must still overcome the third hurdle, and demonstrate that the balance of convenience favours the grant of the injunction sought."
315,s308,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,It is common ground that CSL carries the onus on this issue.
316,s309,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"99 The real question in this proceeding, as in many similar cases, is where does the balance of convenience lie?"
317,s310,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"In that regard, I am inclined to the view that each side has overstated its case in relation to this matter."
318,s311,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,100 CSL's evidence that its sales representatives are being diverted from extolling the virtues of GARDASIL to general practitioners by being forced to defend that product from GSKA's claims regarding CERVARIX seems to me to have been extremely tenuous.
319,s312,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"The fact that CERVARIX may be available for sale in 2007 would be likely, of itself, to raise questions in the minds of general practitioners about the respective merits of the two products."
320,s313,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,That is so irrespective of the representations contained in the GSKA Information Sheet.
321,s314,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"101 With regard to other impending harm, it seems to me to be improbable that GSKA's representations, as contained in its information sheet, would be likely to influence the deliberations of Federal Cabinet."
322,s315,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,The risk that the PBAC might be influenced by those representations is significantly reduced by the fact that CERVARIX will not be approved by the TGA this year.
323,s316,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,The PBAC is unlikely to make any final decisions regarding CERVARIX while TGA approval is still pending for that product.
324,s317,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,CSL's claims for final injunctive relief will have been determined long before the TGA has completed its review.
325,s318,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,102 GSKA's evidence as to the harm that it would suffer if it were temporarily restrained from repeating the representations that were made in its information sheet seems to me also to have been overstated.
326,s319,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"For one thing, CSL made it plain at the hearing, if it was not already clear, that it was not seeking to prevent GSKA from making whatever claims it wished to the TGA about CERVARIX, as part of GSKA's ongoing application for approval."
327,s320,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,That made some of the evidence upon which GSKA relied redundant.
328,s321,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"103 In addition, the fact that GSKA might be forced, for a relatively short period, to refrain from engaging in comparisons between GARDASIL and CERVARIX of the type contained in the GSKA Information Sheet hardly seems to me to have the serious consequences for GSKA, and its marketing plans, that Mr Herd foreshadowed."
329,s322,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"104 Although, I accept that damages would not be an adequate remedy if CSL were to succeed in establishing the various breaches of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act that it alleges, the same is probably true for GSKA in relation to the utility of any undertaking as to damages given by CSL."
330,s323,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,"105 After weighing the evidence carefully, I am not persuaded that the balance of convenience favours the grant of interlocutory relief."
331,s324,CSL Limited v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 (3 October 2006),06_1301.xml,I accept that the submissions on this issue are finely balanced.

78,s73,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"  Following this review of the background to the creditor's petition and Mr Field's notice of opposition, the Federal Magistrates Court (at [21]-[23]) referred to the analysis of authorities by Allsop J in Totev v Sfar (2006) 230 ALR 236 ; [2006] FCA 470 at [37] - [44] as useful, particularly Allsop J's observation at [44] in these terms:   ...what is clear is that the fact that there has been an act of bankruptcy does not make the claim by the debtor against the petitioning creditor irrelevant."
79,s74,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,It should be examined to assess whether it can be said that there is sufficient evidence to show that it is a real claim which is likely to succeed.
80,s75,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Also relevant is the stage of the litigation, the length of time for its vindication and any other relevant matters."
81,s76,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,It goes without saying that solvency is a relevant consideration.

85,s80,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"As Olney J identified in [ Re James; Ex parte Carter Holt Harvey Roofing (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) (1994) 51 FCR 14] , if a likelihood of success can be demonstrated, that may justify a refusal of a sequestration order."
86,s81,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Alternatively, the circumstances may reveal a claim of a character and nature in which likelihood of success cannot be predicted with accuracy but in the circumstances the petition should be dismissed or an adjournment of the petition should granted: see the approach of Sundberg J in Ling v Commonwealth [1996] FCA 1646 ; (1996) 68 FCR 180 at 195---196, with which Wilcox J and Whitlam J agreed."
87,s82,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"If the claim is one in which credit of witnesses will be involved, and a debtor sets out the nature and detail of the case and all his or her evidence the debtor may only be able to persuade the bankruptcy court that, if relevant criteria are believed, he or she has good prospects of success."

91,s86,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"  The Federal Magistrates Court then reasoned as follows: (1) Various considerations meant that neither the Federal Court proceeding nor the administrative law proceedings could be characterised as ""'likely to succeed', or even as 'a real claim'"" (at [24])."
92,s87,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"(2) Both proceedings were ""far from 'well advanced'""."
93,s88,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"This caused the Federal Magistrate to comment that ""[c]ertainly, there is little present prospect that either of these very complex claims could be litigated to a successful completion within the life of this petition, which is due to expire on 7 November 2009""."
94,s89,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Accordingly, his Honour could ""see little prospect that additional merit in the claims will emerge before that date to justify further adjournment under an extension of the petition under s 52(5) ""."

96,s91,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Mr Field's delay in bringing both sets of litigation until the brink of bankruptcy, and his failure to press for any stays, expedition or other interim orders which recognise the urgency of his predicament, leaves me doubtful of his capacity to achieve any improvement in his prospects of success within the lifetime of the petition, even if it is extended under s 52(5) "" (at [25])."
97,s92,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"(3) His Honour also was ""not persuaded that this could be achieved by Mr Field gaining a preliminary hearing in one of the courts on the issue of the validity of the execution of the Jenolan Deed on behalf of the Trust""."
98,s93,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"His Honour observed that ""there is no evidence that any application for a separate trial of this issue has been made, nor that it is likely to be granted."
99,s94,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Moreover, even if such a ruling were achieved it would not, in my opinion, significantly advance Mr Field's prospects of achieving relief which off-sets his liability to the Bank."
100,s95,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"His claims for this relief face some major difficulties, and Mr Field's evidence and submissions have not explained to me reasonably arguable solutions"" (at [26])."
101,s96,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"His Honour described one of these difficulties in [27] in these terms:   ...even if the Jenolan Deed was held to be void of legal effect, it is not apparent that this would allow the return to JCR of any valuable rights of a lessee under the 99 year lease."
102,s97,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,This is because they would appear to have expired by effluxion of time under cl 12.7.
103,s98,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,  (4) His Honour referred in [28] to other difficulties facing Mr Field including:   ...establishing standing to make claims which appear to be those of JCR only; in answering the contractual effects of the waiver provisions of the guarantee; in finding evidence of misleading or unconscionable conduct on the part of the Bank during 2005 and 2006; in explaining his delays in seeking equitable or other similar discretionary relief; and in winding back the legal effects of the liquidation of JCR.
104,s99,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"  (5) His Honour described the ""clearest difficulty facing Mr Field"" on the material presented as the lack of any likely material advantage to JCR or Mr Field flowing from the relief sought sufficient to off-set the debt to St George (at [29])."
105,s100,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"His Honour, in [30], explained that the material he had in mind was the report dated 14 August 2006 from PPB chartered accountants, in their capacity as administrators of JCR."
106,s101,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"His Honour said:   The evidence gives me no reason not to give weight to their opinions, particularly since their objectivity and competence to assess the value to JCR of litigation of the sort now contemplated by Mr Field was not challenged."
107,s102,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,It is clear that they closely considered the foundations of Mr Field's claims of very substantial loss arising from the making of the Jenolan Deed.
108,s103,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In particular, they examined a valuation report of Messrs Magin and Roberts obtained in 2001 by JCR for financing purposes, upon which Mr Field largely pins his claim that the true value of the lease in 2006 exceeded $11m, rather than the total consideration of $2.350m which reached the receivers."
109,s104,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The administrators pointed to substantial reasons for doubting the 2001 valuation, and its continuing weight."
110,s105,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The relevant passages in their report are too lengthy for me to extract, but I find their analysis of the various valuations and the history of JCR and its receivership to be strongly persuasive."
111,s106,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"  (6) Accordingly, his Honour concluded at [32]-[34] that:   [ 32 ] In the face of the JCR administrators' analysis, and on all the evidence before me, I am not persuaded that Mr Field has established any real prospects of gaining an outcome in his current litigation which would exceed the value of the Bank's debt upon which the petition is based."
112,s107,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Moreover, bringing into consideration the other difficulties facing this litigation, I am not persuaded that Mr Field has been able to raise a public interest in allowing the litigation to continue, which outweighs the public interest in allowing Mr Field's creditor to take his estate into bankruptcy administration."
113,s108,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"    [ 33 ] In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account Mr Field's genuine desire to litigate so as to vindicate his contentions about the failure of his business and the losses he has suffered."
114,s109,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,I am conscious that he contends that his incurring of the debt to the Bank occurred as a result of its conduct towards JCR during 2005 and 2006 which he is seeking to characterise as unlawful or improper.
115,s110,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"However, his pending litigation presents such a cloud of uncertainty as to its merits, value, and future progress, that I am unable to characterise it in the terms required under the authorities cited above, both in relation to dismissing a petition or adjourning it."
116,s111,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"I am left with an impression that the relevant public interests support, rather than otherwise, the vesting in a trustee in bankruptcy of a power to decide, in the interests of all creditors, the future continuance of that litigation."
117,s112,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"    [ 34 ] I therefore am not persuaded by the ground of the notice of opposition, and consider that it is appropriate to proceed immediately to make a sequestration order."
118,s113,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"  In a part of the reasons described as a ""postscript"" the Federal Magistrate made the following observations in [35]-[36]:   [ 35 ] After completing the above judgment, my attention was drawn by the Bank's solicitor to the judgment of Barrett J given on 5 June 2009 in Field v Jenolan Caves Resort Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 491."
119,s114,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"His Honour dismissed Mr Field's Supreme Court Administrative Law List proceeding against the Bank, and also refused to grant Mr Field leave to proceed against JCR in that proceeding."
120,s115,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"At [28] he concluded that summary dismissal was appropriate:      Because, first, the causes of action sought to be advanced by Mr Field's statement of claim are causes of action belonging exclusively to JCR and are in no sense available to Mr Field himself and, second, Mr Field has no authority or capacity to sue on behalf JCR, the statement of claim filed by Mr Field and by which he seeks declaratory and other relief must be regarded as disclosing no viable cause of action."
121,s116,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The appropriate course is therefore the first for which St George contends, namely, that the Administrative Law List proceedings as a whole be dismissed as against St George."
122,s117,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"     [ 36 ] The evidence before me made no mention of the interlocutory applications which were addressed by Barrett J, and their hearing on 26 May 2009 occurred subsequent to the hearing of the present petition."
123,s118,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In my opinion, the orders and reasons of Barrett J support the opinions I have explained above as to the lack of prospects attending both the Supreme Court and Federal Court proceedings."
124,s119,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"  PRINCIPLES  As St George submitted, it is necessary to begin with an appreciation of the nature of an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate under s 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)."

157,s152,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Instead, the statement of claim records various events which occurred about eight years after the giving of the guarantee said to give rise to various causes of action."
158,s153,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Second, the relationship between the subsequent events about which complaint is made and Mr Field's liability under the guarantee is obscure."
159,s154,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The statement of claim does not disclose how the subsequent events are capable of leading to the relief claimed given the waivers in the guarantee.
160,s155,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Third, and as the Federal Magistrate observed at [28] and St George noted in its submissions, JCR is not a party to the Federal Court proceeding."
161,s156,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"But many, possibly most, of the matters about which complaint is made in the statement of claim are complaints which only JCR can make in circumstances where Mr Field has no right or standing to make a claim on JCR's behalf."
162,s157,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Mr Field sought to make good this difficulty by pointing to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act and s 12GF of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act that a person who has suffered loss or damage by reason of misleading and deceptive conduct need not be a party to the transaction.
163,s158,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,But this is at best an answer only in part (if at all) to the problems confronting the Federal Court proceeding.
164,s159,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The Federal Court proceeding seeks to set aside the Jenolan Deed and the transfer of the lease thereby affecting the rights of third parties.
165,s160,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Mr Field's oral submissions tried to address this problem by indicating that these claims are unnecessary and could be deleted and, in any event, the issue of invalidity of the administrator's appointment and its consequences could be determined as facts along the way without joining all interested parties."
166,s161,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"However, the fact is that these claims were in the application as before the Federal Magistrate and remained in the application as at the hearing of this appeal."
167,s162,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Moreover, these claims are relevant to the claims for damages for misleading and deceptive conduct."
168,s163,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Alleged knowledge on the part of St George of the supposed invalidity of the administrator's appointment, or facts that should have alerted St George to that effect, is an essential part of the factual matrix of the claims for damages."
169,s164,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Fourth, and consistent with St George's submissions, the facts of the present case do not readily appear to engage any principle about lack of capacity to contract out of statutory protections from misleading and deceptive conduct."
170,s165,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,In May 1997 Mr Field gave a guarantee the key terms of which have been identified at [5] above.
171,s166,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Events many years later said to involve unconscionable and misleading or deceptive conduct are then relied upon to assert some right to escape liability under that guarantee and to found claims for damages.
172,s167,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,How claims to this effect are to be sustained is difficult to comprehend as the Federal Magistrate properly recognised.
173,s168,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Fifth, and as should be apparent from the discussion above, the facts asserted in the statement of claim and the propositions of law on which it depends are far from being ""beyond real dispute""."
174,s169,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The facts include alleged oral representations based on a meeting in November 2005 (para 22).
175,s170,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Oral representations from many years ago are notorious for generating disputes.
176,s171,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The propositions of law include the invalidity of the appointment of an administrator on the basis of an alleged procedural defect.
177,s172,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"As St George submitted, the allegation of invalidity of the appointment of the administrator depends on an argument that s 58ZE of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (NSW) only permitted appointment if there were members of the Trust at the time of appointment when, in this case, all memberships had expired."
178,s173,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The legal arguments to which this claim might give rise are numerous, as St George observed."
179,s174,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"For example, s 58ZE would have to be construed purposively before the question of breach could be answered."
180,s175,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Further, even if breach occurred, the consequence is only invalidity if that purpose may be inferred in accordance with the canons of construction ( Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355; [1998] HCA 28 at [91] - [93] )."
181,s176,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Finally, the Jenolan Deed has been carried into effect and, amongst other things, the transfer of the lease has been registered under the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW)."
182,s177,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Each of these matters involves a substantial hurdle to Mr Field's claims of invalidity of the appointment of the administrator to the Trust.
183,s178,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"For present purposes, it is sufficient to make the following points."
184,s179,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In terms of a purposive construction, the effect of Mr Field's argument is that where the terms of appointment of each member of the Trust has expired, the Minister, if he or she wishes to appoint an administrator, must appoint members by a notice in the NSW Government Gazette, then remove those members by another (possibly even the same) notice in the NSW Government Gazette and finally appoint the administrator by notice in the NSW Government Gazette (again possibly by the same notice)."
185,s180,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,This is not an attractive construction of s 58ZE(1) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act .
186,s181,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Mr Field's answer, that the National Parks and Wildlife Act evinces an intention that the Trusts control the reserved land, cannot stand in the face of s 58W(2) which makes the Trust subject to the control and direction of the Minister."
187,s182,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Even as a matter of language alone, and ignoring the wider context of the provision, there is little to support an argument that powers vested in the Minister to either ""remove any or all members of the Trust board"" or ""remove all members of the Trust Board...and appoint a person as an administrator of the Trust"" should be read as requiring the appointment and removal of Board members before the power of appointment of an administrator can be exercised."
188,s183,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In terms of the consequences of breach, invalidity can only result from a conclusion that the ""the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition"" evinces a legislative intention ""to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition"" ( Project Blue Sky at [91])."
189,s184,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Public inconvenience is a relevant factor in this process of construction.
190,s185,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The invalidating of every act of the administrator of the Trust merely because the Minister did not go through a charade of appointing members only to remove them and thereby (on Mr Field's argument) enliven the Minister's power to appoint an administrator would result in an extraordinary level of public inconvenience.
191,s186,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Even a finding of fact to that effect, without any consequential declarations, raises real issues of public inconvenience."
192,s187,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,This is a formidable hurdle which Mr Field's submissions sought to circumvent by asserting that the condition in question determined the availability of the power so that the principles identified in Project Blue Sky did not apply.
193,s188,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,But the principles in Project Blue Sky assume and look to the consequences of breach of statutory conditions of all classes.
194,s189,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In terms of the registration of the transfer of the lease under the Real Property Act , the grant of relief to Mr Field may be affected by the indefeasibility of the title as registered either as a matter of law or discretion (see, by analogy, City of Canada Bay Council v F amp; D Bonaccorso Pty Ltd (2007) 71 NSWLR 424 ; [2007] NSWCA 351)."
195,s190,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"For these reasons, I am satisfied that Mr Field's claim to the effect that the appointment of the administrator of the Trust was invalid with the consequence of invalidating the administrators subsequent transactions (including the giving of notices under the lease and the entry into the Jenolan Deed) has no real prospects of success."
196,s191,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Sixth, these matters affect many of Mr Field's claims in the Federal Court proceeding."
197,s192,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"For example, in oral submissions Mr Field advanced an argument that the report of JCR's administrators, PPB chartered accountants, dated 14 August 2006 was inaccurate in many respects including by reason of a statement that the receivers and managers had a limited timeframe to achieve a sale of the lease."
198,s193,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,This was said to be incorrect because all notices issued by the Trust's administrator under the lease were invalid due to his invalid appointment.
199,s194,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Similarly, Mr Field contended that the Federal Magistrate erred by assuming the validity of that appointment for the purpose of his Honour's observation in [27] that JCR's rights appear to have expired by effluxion of time under cl 12.7 of the lease with the consequence that JCR's rights may not return any value in any event."
200,s195,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Given the observations above about the numerous difficulties confronting Mr Field's argument of invalidity of the appointment of the Trust's administrator it is difficult to accept that either the receivers and managers or the Federal Magistrate erred.
201,s196,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Further, and as these submissions disclose, the invalidity of the appointment of the Trust's administrator (and all of its associated problems) is a fact embedded in many of Mr Field's claims."
202,s197,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Finally, this is not a case of any mere difficulty in resolving Mr Field's claims."
203,s198,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Mr Field had to establish ""other sufficient cause"" so that a sequestration order ought not to be made within the meaning of s 52(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act ."
204,s199,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The Federal Magistrate was entitled and indeed bound to examine the cogency of the claims in the Federal Court proceeding and their likely prospects of success.
205,s200,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,In so doing the Federal Magistrate was entitled also to take the proceeding as it stood at the time of the hearing.
206,s201,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,His Honour was not obliged to hypothesise possible ways in which the proceeding could be recast to make more sense or improve its prospects.
207,s202,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In these circumstances the conclusions of the Federal Magistrate about the Federal Court proceeding were amply supported by the available evidence, namely, that: (i) the statement of claim is obscure, presents obvious difficulties, and is unlikely to survive interlocutory scrutiny, (ii) the proceeding could not be described as well advanced, and (iii) the proceeding could not be described as either likely to succeed or even as a real claim."
208,s203,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The Federal Magistrate also cogently explained his reasons for so concluding.
209,s204,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,It follows that I do not accept any of the grounds of appeal relating to the Federal Court proceeding.
210,s205,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,I turn to each ground relevant to the Federal Court proceeding in the light of the conclusions above.
211,s206,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 1 is a general assertion of error which appears to depend on one or more of the other grounds being sustained.
212,s207,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,As none are sustainable ground 1 falls away.
213,s208,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Ground 2, insofar as the reference to ""other considerations"" outweighing the making or deferral of a sequestration order should be understood as a reference to the Federal Court proceeding, is a mere assertion that the Federal Magistrate should have reached a different conclusion without the exposure of any error in his Honour's reasoning process."
214,s209,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 3 depends on the Federal Court proceeding having a sufficient likelihood of success so as to warrant a finding of a sufficient cause not to make or to defer making a sequestration order.
215,s210,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,For the reasons given I am satisfied that the Federal Magistrate's conclusions about the lack of prospects of success of the Federal Court proceeding as pleaded were correct.
216,s211,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Ground 4 depends on a finding that, irrespective of the prospects of success, the character and nature of the Federal Court proceeding warranted a finding of a sufficient cause not to make or to defer making a sequestration order."
217,s212,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,I can see nothing in the evidence to support the making of such a finding.
218,s213,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"As noted, the statement of claim does not refer to any fact, matter or circumstance at the time of entry into the guarantee that would have had the effect of invalidating it."
219,s214,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The claim appears to depend on events some eight years after entry into the guarantee to absolve Mr Field from liability.
220,s215,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The statement of claim does not confront in any meaningful way the numerous difficulties identified above.
221,s216,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 5 cannot be sustained insofar as it alleges a failure by the Federal Magistrate to consider the prospects of success of the causes of action in the Federal Court proceeding.
222,s217,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The Federal Magistrate's reasons disclose the contrary.
223,s218,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,As to the other errors alleged in ground 5: (1) I am satisfied that the Federal Magistrate's reasons disclose a correct understanding of the relief sought in the statement of claim.
224,s219,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The discharge from liability under the guarantee is based on events subsequent to its making by reason of alleged unconscionable conduct.
225,s220,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Yet the claim does not confront the terms of the guarantee.
226,s221,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"(2) The complaint about the Federal Magistrate's description of the Federal Court proceeding as an attempt ""to present the facts and claims which were raised in the amended response before McDougall J"" (at [16]) is unfounded."
227,s222,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In the Supreme Court proceedings Mr Field did make the same allegations about the invalidity of the appointment of the administrator, the same complaints about the Trust's actions and the actions of St George."
228,s223,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"It is true that the Supreme Court proceedings did not make the same express claims that, in consequence, St George had acted unconscionably in making its demands for payment."
229,s224,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"But the document filed by Mr Field in those proceedings did expressly claim that, by its actions, St George discharged the guarantee, breached s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and that it would be unjust and inequitable for St George to rely on the guarantee."
230,s225,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The Federal Magistrate's summary description of the Federal Court proceeding being equivalent to the Supreme Court proceeding in [16] was correct.
231,s226,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"(3) The complaint about the Federal Magistrate's reference to the obscurity of the statement of claim and the lack of a clear pleading, as reasoned at [21] above, is also unfounded."
232,s227,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,His Honour's description was accurate.
233,s228,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 8 alleges an error by the Federal Magistrate in concluding that the Federal Court proceeding had little prospect of successful completion by 7 November 2009.
234,s229,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The Federal Magistrate, at [25], said that ""there is little present prospect that either of these very complex claims could be litigated to a successful completion within the life of this petition, which is due to expire on 7 November 2009"" and, at [26], that ""I am not persuaded that this could be achieved by Mr Field gaining a preliminary hearing in one of the courts on the issue of the validity of the execution of the Jenolan Deed on behalf of the Trust."
235,s230,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"I note that there is no evidence that any application for a separate trial of this issue has been made, nor that it is likely to be granted."
236,s231,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Moreover, even if such a ruling were achieved it would not, in my opinion, significantly advance Mr Field's prospects of achieving relief which off-sets his liability to the Bank."
237,s232,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"His claims for this relief face some major difficulties, and Mr Field's evidence and submissions have not explained to me reasonably arguable solutions""."
238,s233,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Mr Field's complaint appears to be based on a challenge to the latter proposition concerning a separate hearing about the validity of the Jenolan Deed.
239,s234,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"But, as the Federal Magistrate may be taken to have understood, a separate hearing has to have utility for the resolution of the real issues in the proceeding as a whole."
240,s235,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Mr Field's claims about invalidity of the Jenolan Deed are confronted by numerous difficulties.
241,s236,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The legal link between the invalidity of the Jenolan Deed and a right in Mr Field to obtain a discharge from liability under the guarantee remains obscure.
242,s237,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Hence, the Federal Magistrate's characterisation of the position was justified on the evidence and, in my view, correct."
243,s238,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 9 is derivative and depends on one of the other grounds being upheld.
244,s239,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"As such, the ground must fail."
245,s240,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 10 alleges that the Federal Magistrate failed to give weight or sufficient weight to the fact that many of the allegations in the statement of claim in the Federal Court proceeding are either substantiated or unlikely to raise a substantial dispute.
246,s241,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,This ground seems to rise no higher than mere assertion.
247,s242,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,It simply ignores the numerous factual and legal difficulties to which the statement of claim gives rise.
248,s243,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 11 repeats the allegation that the Federal Magistrate failed to give weight or sufficient weight to the fact that the validity of the Jenolan Deed could be determined quickly as a discrete legal issue at a separate hearing.
249,s244,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The Federal Magistrate dealt with this suggestion and rightly concluded that it was unlikely and of dubious utility given the essential issue of liability under a guarantee which contains waivers of the type in the guarantee in question.
250,s245,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 14 repeats the complaint about the Federal Magistrate's conclusion that the statement of claim in the Federal Court proceeding was obscure and unlikely to survive interlocutory scrutiny.
251,s246,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,I am satisfied that the Federal Magistrate's conclusion was justified given my observations above.
252,s247,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 15 alleges that the Federal Magistrate failed to properly take into account the delay in the Federal Court proceeding by reason of St George's notice of motion filed 17 April 2009 seeking orders that the statement of claim be struck out.
253,s248,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Insofar as Mr Field said the Federal Magistrate erred by treating delays as relevant to the merits of the proceeding, I reject the submission."
254,s249,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The Federal Magistrate did no such thing.
255,s250,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,His Honour referred to the lack of urgency apparent in Mr Field's actions (at [25]) as making it doubtful that Mr Field would have a capacity to improve his prospects of success within the lifetime of the petition.
256,s251,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,This conclusion was open and able to be drawn on the evidence.
257,s252,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Insofar as Mr Field relied on St George's motion filed 17 April 2009, the fact is that the obvious problems with the statement of claim made such an application for strike out likely."
258,s253,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Contrary to Mr Field's submissions, it appears that St George was not required to file and serve a defence in the Federal Court proceeding if it filed and served a notice of motion to strike out the proceeding, as it has done."
259,s254,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"THE SUPREME COURT PROCEEDINGS  Grounds 7, 12 and 13 relate to the way in which the Federal Magistrates Court dealt with aspects of the Supreme Court proceedings."
260,s255,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Mr Field's submissions In support of these grounds Mr Field denied that the Federal Court proceeding attempted to present in better form the claims in the Supreme Court proceedings.
261,s256,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Mr Field also submitted that the amended commercial list response which he filed was struck out not for any failure to disclose a proper case with adequate prospects of success but because of its inadequacy as a response for the purpose of the Supreme Court's commercial list.
262,s257,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"According to Mr Field, the facts pleaded and relief claimed in the Federal Court proceeding go far beyond anything that could have been raised in the Supreme Court proceedings."
263,s258,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Discussion I have already concluded above that the Federal Magistrate's summary characterisation of the Federal Court proceeding was open to be made and, indeed, accurate."
264,s259,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Further, in the Supreme Court proceedings McDougall J did consider Mr Field's prospects of success in respect of the various claims made for discharge of liability under the guarantee."
265,s260,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"McDougall J, at [17] and [20] in St George Bank Limited v Archer Phillip Field [2007] NSWSC 902 , said:   [ 17 ] Against that background, it is therefore necessary to consider the issues that might be raised."
266,s261,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,I have set them out above.
267,s262,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"A number of those issues refer to conduct of St George, by its servants and agents, which has the effect of discharging the guarantee, or of relieving Mr Field of liability under it, or of making it unjust for St George to seek to enforce the guarantee."
268,s263,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"On the face of things, they are all rights that Mr Field has bargained away by the clauses of the guarantee to which I have referred."
269,s264,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,It is clear that the courts will give effect to such a bargain: see Mason CJ in The Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 at 407.
270,s265,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In the particular context of a guarantee, see the decision of Brennan J in Buckeridge v Mercantile Credits Limited [1981] HCA 62 ; (1981) 147 CLR 654 at 675."
271,s266,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"To the extent that Mr Field wishes to raise those issues, they are issues that are foreclosed by the terms to which I have referred."
272,s267,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"...     [ 20 ] In those circumstances, I do not think that there is any utility in giving Mr Field yet a further opportunity to seek to articulate some defence."
273,s268,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Nothing has been put, either supported by evidence or even based on submissions from the bar table, that would indicate a defence that can stand in the face of the contractual provisions to which I have referred, explained as they are by the authorities to which I have referred."
274,s269,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"  The facts pleaded and relief sought in the Federal Court proceeding do go further than that of the Supreme Court proceedings (specifically, in terms of the claims for damages by reason of misleading and deceptive conduct), but the essence is the same: invalidity of the Jenolan Deed and a discharge of Mr Field's liability under the guarantee."
275,s270,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 7 alleges error in the Federal Magistrate failing to find or consider that Mr Field could not have raised the same matters in the Supreme Court proceedings as now raised in the Federal Court proceeding.
276,s271,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In answer, I have already noted in [50] above that the essence of the two proceedings is largely the same."
277,s272,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Further, apart from bare assertion, Mr Field's submissions provided no meaningful explanation of the reasons precluding the seeking of similar relief in the Supreme Court proceedings, other than the obvious difficulties presented by the terms of the guarantee itself, which is no more addressed in the Federal Court proceeding than it was in the Supreme Court proceedings."
278,s273,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 12 is bordering on the meaningless.
279,s274,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Insofar as it alleges that the Federal Magistrate should not or could not have taken into account McDougall J's conclusions that the waiver provisions in the guarantee presented insuperable difficulties for Mr Field in the Supreme Court proceedings, I disagree."
280,s275,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The Federal Magistrate was entitled to have regard to the fact that, in the Supreme Court proceedings, Mr Field also claimed a discharge from any liability under the guarantee but was unable to formulate an arguable defence in support of that claim."
281,s276,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Ground 13 also seems to be repetitive of the substance of grounds 7 and 11 in that it alleges that Mr Field could not raise certain matters in the Supreme Court proceedings by reason of the waiver provisions in the guarantee but is not subject to the same constraint in the Federal court proceeding.
282,s277,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"But, as noted, the statement of claim in the Federal Court proceeding discloses no fact, matter or circumstance relevant to the validity of the guarantee at the time of its making."
283,s278,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Mr Field relies on events years later as matters disentitling St George from enforcing the guarantee and discharging Mr Field from any liability under it.
284,s279,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Yet the terms of the guarantee, including the waivers, remain."
285,s280,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"As noted, the fact that the Federal Court proceeding involves claims based on statutes for unconscionable and misleading and deceptive conduct, and consequential damages, does not undermine the Federal Magistrate's conclusions about the ultimate prospect of the proceeding or the difficulties that Mr Field would have to confront in the event of interlocutory challenge."
286,s281,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,THE JENOLAN DEED  Ground 16 relates to the Federal Magistrates Court's conclusions about the immateriality of the validity of the Jenolan Deed.
287,s282,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The Federal Magistrate, at [27], said that ""[o]ne of the difficulties is, as was pointed out by counsel for the Bank, that even if the Jenolan Deed was held to be void of legal effect, it is not apparent that this would allow the return to JCR of any valuable rights of a lessee under the 99 year lease."
288,s283,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"This is because they would appear to have expired by effluxion of time under cl 12.7""."
289,s284,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,For the reasons given above I am unable to see how this observation involves an error given the numerous problems that Mr Field would have to confront in his claim that the Trust administrator's appointment was invalid and the consequential lack of prospects of that claim.
290,s285,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,REJECTION OF EVIDENCE  Ground 6 relates to the Federal Magistrate's refusal to admit into evidence the appellant's affidavit sworn 20 May 2009.
291,s286,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"At [19]-[20] the Federal Magistrate said:   [ 19 ] In an affidavit filed two days before the hearing of the petition, Mr Field attempted to add to his grounds of opposition a contention that the Bank has failed to ""provide me with a report of its investigations"" in response to a complaint to it under the Code of Banking Practice."
292,s287,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"His complaint was made by letter dated 16 June 2006 to the chairman of the Bank, and made numerous detailed criticisms of how officers of the Bank had responded to correspondence and events during 2005 and 2006."
293,s288,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Although this letter was in a very large bundle of documents exhibited to his affidavit, it received no mention in the affidavit and had no apparent relevance to the grounds of opposition except as background of dubious relevance."
294,s289,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The Bank's responses to the complaint were not in the bundle, nor, understandably, in its evidence in reply to the notice of opposition."
295,s290,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,    [ 20 ] It is not apparent to me how the evidence of this complaint could substantially advance Mr Field's grounds of opposition.
296,s291,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The raising of the additional issues at a late stage, and outside the time-tables previously directed by the Court, was opposed by counsel for the Bank."
297,s292,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,He pointed to prejudice facing the Bank's legal representatives in attempting to take instructions on short notice about the issues raised by the 2006 complaint and the attack on its handling.
298,s293,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Taking into account both that prejudice, and my difficulty in discerning how the matter materially advances Mr Field's opposition to the petition, I refused leave to rely upon these parts of the affidavit and upon the new contention."
299,s294,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,  I can see no error in the Federal Magistrate's decision to refuse to admit this material into evidence.
300,s295,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The material was rejected on a discretionary ground (delay and the late raising of additional issues).
301,s296,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Nothing suggests any error of principle in the Federal Magistrate's rejection of this material.
302,s297,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The fact that the material had potential relevance to para 45(f) of the statement of claim does not invalidate the Federal Magistrate's conclusion that it was difficult to discern how it advanced Mr Field's position.
303,s298,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Paragraph 45(f) alleges as a particular of the claim for unconscionable conduct that St George failed to apply the Code of Banking Practice to various complaints Mr Field had made.
304,s299,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,The observations of the Federal Magistrate about the difficulties this evidence involved in terms of form and substance and its lateness justified the decision to reject it.
305,s300,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"WRONGFUL ATTRIBUTION OF WEIGHT TO EVIDENCE  Ground 17 alleges an error by the Federal Magistrate in placing weight on evidence described as ""self serving assertions and conclusions of the receivers and managers of Jenolan Caves Resort Pty Limited""."
306,s301,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The difficulty with this ground is that the evidence in question comprised a report to the creditors of JCR by the administrators, not the receivers and managers."
307,s302,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"As the Federal Magistrate rightly said at [30]-[31]:   [ 30 ]...The evidence gives me no reason not to give weight to [the administrators'] opinions, particularly since their objectivity and competence to assess the value to JCR of litigation of the sort now contemplated by Mr Field was not challenged."
308,s303,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,It is clear that they closely considered the foundations of Mr Field's claims of very substantial loss arising from the making of the Jenolan Deed.
309,s304,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In particular, they examined a valuation report of Messrs Magin and Roberts obtained in 2001 by JCR for financing purposes, upon which Mr Field largely pins his claim that the true value of the lease in 2006 exceeded $11m, rather than the total consideration of $2.350m which reached the receivers."
310,s305,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The administrators pointed to substantial reasons for doubting the 2001 valuation, and its continuing weight."
311,s306,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"The relevant passages in their report are too lengthy for me to extract, but I find their analysis of the various valuations and the history of JCR and its receivership to be strongly persuasive."
312,s307,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"They summarised some significant conclusions at p 26:     Summary     For there to be a successful claim against St George or the Receivers and Managers under s 420A of the Act, it would have to be proven that the above transaction was either below market value or if there was no market for the asset, it was realised for below the best price possible."
313,s308,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,    We are of the opinion that this would be a difficult action to pursue for the following reasons:     #8226; The Receivers and Managers obtained formal advice that the asset was unsaleable in its current form;  #8226; The trust was required to consent to the assignment;  #8226; A major factor in ensuring the assets were saleable was negotiating a reduction in the rent payable under the lease.
314,s309,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"While the Receivers and Managers attempted to obtain such a reduction, they were unsuccessful in this regard;  #8226; Major rectification works were required to be undertaken or committed to before any assignment could take place;  #8226; There was a limited timeframe in which to sell the leasehold;  #8226; No co-operative marketing and management structure existed between the cave operator and the resort operator;  #8226; No commitment had been provided by the Trust to upgrade the existing infrastructure and/or services provided under the lease; and  #8226; The Receivers and Managers had undertaken negotiations with three (3) parties, all of which were unsuccessful."
315,s310,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"    We note that the following additional factors also need to be considered in respect of any potential legal action:     #8226; Due to the inherent uncertainty and cost involved in pursuing litigation, a detailed legal opinion would be required as to the merits or otherwise of this claim;  #8226; We currently do not have any funds in the Administration to obtain a legal opinion or become involved in a potentially lengthy or costly litigation; and  #8226; In discussions with the Receivers and Managers, it has been indicated that in the event that any such claim was brought, it would be vigorously defended."
316,s311,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,    [ 31 ] Mr Field's evidence and submissions have not demonstrated to me any real prospect of his being able to overcome the factual or legal foundations of these opinions.
317,s312,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"In my opinion, the administrator's opinions in this summary and elsewhere in their report to creditors, and the evidence to which they point, suggest that there is little prospect that Mr Field will be able to establish that the true value of JCR's business at the time of the Jenolan Deed exceeded the consideration provided in that Deed, whether it was validly or invalidly entered into, and whether or not it was attended by challengeable behaviour by the Bank."
318,s313,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"  The Federal Magistrate was entitled to give weight, including substantial weight, to these matters."
319,s314,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,No error in so doing is disclosed.
320,s315,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,CONCLUSIONS  I am satisfied that none of Mr Field's grounds of appeal are sustainable.
321,s316,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Mr Field has not demonstrated that the Federal Magistrate's conclusions and orders were the result of any legal, factual or discretionary error."
322,s317,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,Having reviewed the available material I am convinced that the Federal Magistrate's conclusions were not only justifiable but correct.
323,s318,Field v St George Bank Limited [2009] FCA 1042 (17 September 2009),09_1042.xml,"Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed with costs."

13,s3,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Prior to that date, the Deputy Commissioner had served a statutory demand upon Ganter with which that company failed to comply."
14,s4,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,The application first came on for hearing before the Court in the Registrar's list on 18 September 2008.
15,s5,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Since then, it has been twice adjourned by Registrars; firstly on 18 September 2008 when it was adjourned until 30 October 2008 and then, secondly, on that date when it was further adjourned until 13 November 2008."
16,s6,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,It suffices to note that the occasion for each of the adjournments appears to have been correspondence directed by or on behalf of Ganter to the Deputy Commissioner indicating that the company was in the process of obtaining finance to enable it to pay the debt due in full and a corresponding request to the Registrar by the Deputy Commissioner to adjourn the application.
17,s7,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"4 Earlier this month and prior to 13 November 2008, like correspondence was directed to the Deputy Commissioner by the solicitors acting for Ganter."
18,s8,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"An adjournment of the proceeding for a further four weeks ""so that finance can be secured"" was proposed."
19,s9,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"On this occasion, the Deputy Commissioner signified that he would not agree to an adjournment."
20,s10,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Instead, on 4 November 2008, the Deputy Commissioner advised the solicitors for Ganter that an order for the winding up of the company would be sought on 13 November 2008 ""unless payment in full in cleared funds is received on or before 13 November 2008""."
21,s11,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"The preceding day Ganter had made a payment of $150,000 to the Deputy Commissioner in reduction of the amount then due to the Commonwealth of Australia and payable to the Commissioner of Taxation in respect of a revenue debt."
22,s12,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"That left a balance of $149,762.09 outstanding."
23,s13,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"5 On 5 November 2008, having confirmed that the amount owed as at that date was $149,762.09, the Deputy Commissioner advised the solicitors acting for Ganter that, if that sum was paid prior to the hearing of the application on 13 November 2008, the Deputy Commissioner would seek the adjournment of the proceedings ""until all funds have been cleared and then dismiss the wind up application at the next return date""."
24,s14,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"6 Thereafter, an endeavour was made by Ganter to transfer the advised outstanding amount to the credit of an account maintained by the Deputy Commissioner on behalf of the Commonwealth."
25,s15,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"That endeavour failed, not through any fault on the part of the Ganter, but apparently because of an inability on the part of the banking system to annotate the transfer with all of the identification details specified by the Deputy Commissioner."
26,s16,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"If nothing else, the course of subsequent events in this case might be thought to highlight the desirability of the Commissioner's settling with the major trading banks a means by which such transfers might be facilitated in a mutually satisfactory way."
27,s17,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"That though is a matter for the Commissioner, not the judiciary, for it is the Commissioner who has the responsibility for the general administration of the taxation laws."

29,s19,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,This cheque was delivered to the Brisbane Office of the ATO by Ganter's solicitors under cover of a letter from those solicitors which accurately recited the effect of a conversation which had occurred earlier that day between a solicitor in the employ of that firm and an officer in the Legal Services Branch of the ATO.
30,s20,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"The letter recited that ""you [the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation] intend to adjourn the application, which is presently listed for Thursday 13 November 2008, for one week to allow for the cheque to clear, and that the matter will be dismissed at the next return date upon clearance of the bank cheque""."

32,s22,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,Later that same day an alternative was proposed on behalf of Ganter by its solicitors.
33,s23,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"That was that the winding up application ought to be dismissed on its next return date, ie 13 November 2008."
34,s24,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,That course was not agreed to by the Deputy Commissioner.
35,s25,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Instead, on 12 November 2008, the Deputy Commissioner signified a disposition to seek a one week adjournment the following day."
36,s26,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Ganter's solicitors replied later on 12 November 2008, indicating that they intended to appear on 13 November 2008 so as to seek the dismissal of the winding up application."
37,s27,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"9 When, on 13 November 2008, the application for winding up was called on in the Registrar's list, the solicitors for Ganter sought the dismissal of the application."
38,s28,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,This course was opposed on the part of the Deputy Commissioner who sought adjournment of the application for a further week.
39,s29,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Apprehending, with respect correctly, that a point of general practical utility was raised by the circumstances of the case, the District Registrar then referred the hearing of the application to a Judge, adjourning accordingly for that purpose."
40,s30,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,10 It appears from the evidence that the Deputy Commissioner's nomination of a period of one week for the proposed adjournment of the winding up application was not coincidental.
41,s31,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"It seems that the experience of the ATO in dealing with Australian banks is that, in the ordinary course of events, Australian banks take five working days following the electronic reporting by the ATO to the relevant bank of the receipt of a cheque."
42,s32,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,That electronic reporting seems to be the equivalent of the presentation of the cheque to the bank for payment.
43,s33,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,The inference necessarily arises that the Deputy Commissioner's nomination of one week as the length of the proposed adjournment was informed by a knowledge of this experience with the banks.
44,s34,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"11 In this case, the electronic reporting by the ATO occurred on 11 November 2008 via the Penrith, NSW office of the ATO."
45,s35,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,In the course of his general administration of the taxation laws the Commissioner has determined that the ATO should centralise its processing of payments.
46,s36,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,That task has fallen to the Penrith office.
47,s37,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,It was to there that the Brisbane office forwarded the bank cheque received on 10 November 2008.
48,s38,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,12 Investigations by the ATO of the NAB have disclosed that the bank's position in relation to bank cheques is informed by its membership of the Australian Bankers' Association.
49,s39,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,The NAB's policy in relation to its bank cheques is expressed as follows: The term 'bank cheque' describes a cheque that is issued by a bank.
50,s40,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,Bank cheques are generally treated by the law in the same manner as ordinary cheques.
51,s41,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Although some people regard bank cheques as equivalent to cash, there are certain circumstances where a bank cheque may not be paid."
52,s42,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"To clarify the position, NAB, as a member of the Australian Bankers' Association, adopts the following policy in relation to NAB bank cheques."
53,s43,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Forged or unauthorised If the signature of an officer of NAB is forged or placed on a bank cheque without NAB's authority, NAB is not legally liable for the cheque concerned."
54,s44,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,Materially altered NAB will dishonour a bank cheque that has been fraudulently and materially altered.
55,s45,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"NAB will co-operate with any holder of a cheque, or person who is about to receive it, who may want to verify that the cheque is a valid cheque."
56,s46,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Reported stolen or lost If NAB is told that a bank cheque is stolen or lost and is satisfied that this is the case, NAB will not pay the cheque if it is presented for payment by a person who has no right to it."
57,s47,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,NAB may provide a replacement cheque for a fee.
58,s48,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,Court order restraining payment NAB must observe an order of a court restraining NAB from paying a bank cheque which is presented for payment while the order is in force.
59,s49,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,Failure of consideration for the issue of a bank cheque Where NAB has not received payment for issuing a bank cheque to a customer (e.g.
60,s50,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"your cheque to NAB in payment for the bank cheque is dishonoured), NAB may refuse to pay the bank cheque only if the person presenting the bank cheque for payment: has not given value for it (e.g."
61,s51,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,the bank cheque is stolen); or has given value for it but at the time of doing so he or she knew NAB had not been paid for the cheque (e.g.
62,s52,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,that the cheque in favour of NAB had been dishonoured).
63,s53,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"13 It was not suggested in this proceeding that, so far as a Commonwealth revenue debt is concerned, there is any express statutory provision which alters the usual position which prevails as between creditor and debtor when a cheque is given in payment of a debt."
64,s54,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"That usual position was expressed by Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in National Australia Bank v KDS Construction Services Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 65 ; (1987) 163 CLR 668 , at 676 to be as follows: Generally speaking, when a cheque is given in payment of a debt, it operates as a conditional payment."
65,s55,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,The payment is subject to a condition that the cheque be paid on presentation.
66,s56,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,If it is dishonoured the debt revives.
67,s57,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Although it is sometimes said that the remedy for the primary debt is suspended, the suspension is no more than a consequence of the conditional nature of the payment: Tilley v Official Receiver in Bankruptcy [1960] HCA 86 ; (1960) 103 CLR 529 , at pp 532-533, 535-536, 537."
68,s58,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"The condition is a condition subsequent so that, if the cheque is met, it ranks as an actual payment from the time it was given."
69,s59,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Subject to non-fulfilment of the condition subsequent, the payment is complete at the time when the cheque is accepted by the creditor: Thomson v Moyse (1961) AC 967 , at p 1004."
70,s60,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"14 It was submitted for the Deputy Commissioner that, in the events which had transpired in this case, that usual position had been altered by the signification by the Deputy Commissioner that he would agree to the dismissal of the winding up application once the proceeds of the cheque had been cleared."
71,s61,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,It seems to me though that the evidence is more consistent with the Deputy Commissioner's adopting a position which was in accordance with the general position when a cheque is given in payment of a debt.
72,s62,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,It has been accepted subject to a condition that the cheque would be paid on presentation.
73,s63,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Subject to the fulfilment of that condition, payment of the then outstanding amount of the debt due to the Commonwealth and payable to the Commissioner was complete upon the acceptance by the Deputy Commissioner on 10 November 2008 of the cheque then proffered on behalf of Ganter."
74,s64,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"In this regard, the fact that the proffered cheque was a bank cheque may well have provided a degree of comfort to the Deputy Commissioner in deciding to accept it, but the position would have been the same in law so far as the relationship of debtor and creditor was concerned had the cheque concerned been one where the drawer was other than a bank."
75,s65,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"15 Strictly speaking, a cheque, even a bank cheque, is not a form of legal tender."
76,s66,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Subject to some particular contractual or statutory provision, the only forms of legal tender remain Australian notes or, subject to the limits specified, Australian coins --- see s 36 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and s 16 of the Currency Act 1965 respectively."
77,s67,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"However, in general trade and commerce, as Mason J observed in George v Cluning (1979) 53 ALJR 767 (note) by reference to Canadian authority, a payment by cheque can amount to sufficient payment if not objected to on that account."
78,s68,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"In this case there was no objection made by the Deputy Commissioner on account of Ganter's endeavouring to settle its indebtedness by the tendering of a cheque only, as I have noted a signification that it was accepted subject to a condition that the cheque would be paid on presentation 16 None of this is to suggest that the Deputy Commissioner was under any obligation to accept the proffered cheque."
79,s69,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"When the history of Ganter's endeavours to pay the debt after the filing of the winding up application is recalled and that the company was, by operation of s 459C(2)(a) the Corporations Act 2001 presumed to be insolvent the Deputy Commissioner would have been entitled not to accept the cheque."
80,s70,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"A refusal to accept the cheque would not have eliminated the debt in question: Australian Mid-Eastern Club Ltd v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399 , at 403 (NSWCA); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 830 at [3] per Gyles J."

82,s72,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,That does no more than recognise what will be the effect of the acceptance of the cheque if the condition subsequent as to the clearance of the cheque is met.
83,s73,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,Were the cheque for some reason to be dishonoured the creation in the accounts of the ATO of an entry reversing the credit recorded on 11 November 2008 would be appropriate.
84,s74,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,I note that the account concerned is made accessible to the company's tax agent by the Commissioner in the ordinary course of his administration of the taxation laws.
85,s75,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"18 As it happens, though the period within which, in accordance with the NAB's usual practice, a notice of dishonour might be given to the ATO has yet to elapse, other evidence from the NAB, which was not available at the time when the application came on before the District Registrar on 13 November 2008, suggests that the bank does now have cleared funds available to meet the cheque."
86,s76,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"As at 13 November 2008 the prevailing position, so far as advice to the ATO from the NAB was concerned, was that, even were a special clearance to be sought, it would not be possible to clear the cheque until after 11:00 am on 18 November 2008."
87,s77,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,I am not satisfied on present materials that the condition subsequent has been met.
88,s78,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,19 For Ganter reliance was placed on the following observation made by Barrett J in Bidald Consulting Pty Ltd v Miles Special Builders Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 397 at [11] : [A] plaintiff whose debt has been paid after the time for challenging a s.459E demand based on the debt has expired and before the hearing of the winding up application is no longer able to maintain and pursue that application.
89,s79,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"20 Assuming that the Deputy Commissioner ought presently to be regarded as an applicant whose debt has been paid, it does not, with respect, seem to me to follow that the application must therefore necessarily be dismissed."

91,s81,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"That circumstance would not, in my opinion, put an end to the petition nor would it affect the jurisdiction of the court to hear and determine the petition although, of course, in such circumstances proceedings might not be continued and, if they were, the court could, in the exercise of its discretion, refuse to make a winding up order upon the petition of a person not then a creditor."

97,s87,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"At that time, the Deputy Commissioner was, on any view, a creditor."
98,s88,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Like Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [5]), I am not persuaded that there is any requirement flowing from the Corporations Act that the applicant must continue to be a creditor at the time when the winding up application is heard."
99,s89,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"As his Honour there states (ibid), and though it is cited in a number of cases which he notes, the passage from the judgement of Menzies J in Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance (supra) does not support the existence of any such requirement."
100,s90,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,22 The true position is that the applicant's status as a creditor at the time when the application was made and the presumption flowing from the company's failure to comply with the terms of a statutory demand are sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction to order the winding up of the company.
101,s91,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,That was the conclusion reached by Zeeman J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Guy Holdings Pty Ltd (1994) 116 FLR 314 at 318.
102,s92,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"As did Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [6]), I agree with that conclusion."
103,s93,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"As Zeeman J observed in the Guy Holdings Case (at 320), ""in the case of an application under s 459P where the debt the subject of the statutory demand has been paid after the filing of the application, the application ought to be dismissed unless there is established some positive reason that a winding up order ought to be made""."
104,s94,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"His Honour is there referring to the way in which, in those circumstances, the discretion vested in the Court on the hearing of a winding up application by s 467 of the Corporations Act would ordinarily be exercised."
105,s95,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,23 How should that discretion be exercised as matters presently stand in this case?
106,s96,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,There is no proof that the company owes any other amount either to the Commissioner or to any other creditor.
107,s97,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Perhaps in testimony to the latter, no other creditor of the company has sought to be substituted as an applicant."
108,s98,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"24 In their submissions the solicitors for the company pointed to the observation made by Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [8]), ""With trading companies the existence of a winding up proceeding is a very serious inhibition and has very serious impacts""."
109,s99,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,I respectfully agree.
110,s100,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,That is one reason why it behoves a company which wishes to keep trading to pay its debts as they fall due or at least later to comply with the terms of a statutory demand.
111,s101,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"It is also a reason why, all other things being equal, a Court would be disposed, as a matter of discretion, to dismiss a winding up application if satisfied that the debt owed to the applicant creditor had been paid."
112,s102,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,Another consideration not to be ignored is the protection of the revenue.
113,s103,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Yet another consideration is that Ganter, by its solicitors, initially agreed with the Deputy Commissioner's proposal that on 13 November 2008 the adjournment of the application for one week ought to be sought."
114,s104,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,A further consideration is the public interest in whether a company which is presumed to be insolvent ought to be permitted to continue to trade or whether it ought to be wound up.
115,s105,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,25 Ganter's change of heart as to the course which ought to be taken on 13 November 2008 seems to have been multi-factorial in origin.
116,s106,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Inferentially from the submissions made to me and to the District Registrar it was founded upon what I regard as the misapprehension that the payment of an applicant creditor's debt obliged the Court to dismiss a winding up application, as opposed to that being a factor going to discretion."
117,s107,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Likewise, it seems to have been grounded on the belief that the acceptance of the bank cheque by the Deputy Commissioner extinguished the debt then and there, as opposed to so doing upon the fulfilment of the condition subsequent of the cheque's being cleared."
118,s108,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Further, it seems to have been grounded upon the belief that, the cheque payment having been recorded as a credit on 11 November 2008 in its accounts, the Deputy Commissioner was obliged, as a ""model litigant"" to agree to the dismissal of the winding up application on 13 November 2008."
119,s109,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"26 This, with respect, misapprehends the obligation that falls on those representing the interests of the Crown in civil litigation."
120,s110,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"One of those interests, and it is a vital interest, is the protection of the revenue."
121,s111,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,The Deputy Commissioner would certainly have failed in his duty to the Court as a model litigant had the acceptance of the cheque and the terms upon which it had been accepted not been drawn to the Court's attention on 13 November 2008.
122,s112,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,It was.
123,s113,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Especially as matters then stood as to the clearing of the bank cheque and the Deputy Commissioner's knowledge as to the practice of the NAB in relation to the circumstances in which it would not meet a bank cheque and the time within which any such disposition on the part of the bank would usually be signified, it was not unreasonable for the Deputy Commissioner to resist the dismissal of the application that day."
124,s114,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,The position then to take was a matter for the value judgement of the Deputy Commissioner in the circumstances in the administration of the taxation laws.
125,s115,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,The entry in the accounts of the ATO had no more than a provisional quality about it.
126,s116,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,27 As at 13 November 2008 there was no obligation on the part of the Court then to dismiss the application.
127,s117,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,The disposal of the application then called for the exercise of a discretion.
128,s118,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,It still does.
129,s119,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Though there is more confidence now that the condition subsequent will be met, it seems to me in the circumstances of this case that Ganter ought to be held to the terms upon which it asked and the Deputy Commissioner agreed to accept the cheque and to seek the adjournment of the winding up application."
130,s120,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"I therefore adjourn the hearing of the application until 19 November 2008 at 9:30 am, the date requested by the Deputy Commissioner."
131,s121,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,"Even assuming that there is power so to do, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to make a conditional order of dismissal, which was an alternative suggested on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner."
132,s122,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v BK Ganter Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1730 (18 November 2008),08_1730.xml,28 I shall hear the parties as to costs.

19,s7,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,I am satisfied that the decision by the Tribunal on the third occasion the matter was before it was not made in good faith.

139,s127,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"There was a s 424A letter dated 5 November 2004 sent to the second appellant, the response of which was considered by the second Tribunal."
140,s128,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,Further letters of invitation were sent by fax on 17 October 2007.
141,s129,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"As the third Tribunal noted:   These letters have not been reproduced in this decision record, because of the length of the invitations."
142,s130,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"  In question 8 of the letter, an officer of the Tribunal asked (with necessary changes to ensure anonymity):   In [SZFSG's] Application for a Protection visa, lodged on 4 March 1999, there is a reference to [a named person], who is noted as his brother."
143,s131,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"Further, in the Application for Migration to Australia, by [SZFSG's] sister, she also notes [the same named person] as her brother."

145,s133,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"That is, that you [NAOX] are not [SZFSG's] brother."
146,s134,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"  In response to this request , the appellants went to the trouble and expense of securing DNA evidence."
147,s135,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,The DNA testing report from DNA Laboratories Sydney was carried out on each appellant.
148,s136,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"In the light of question 8, the report says:   Y chromosome analysis was also conducted on the samples from [each appellant] to try and establish if a common male lineage exists."
149,s137,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"  The report states that the result of the testing ""excludes common paternal relationship""."
150,s138,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,The report further states:   The relationship testing results and mismatches on the Y chromosome do not support evidence of any genetic relationship between [NAOX] and [SZFSG].
151,s139,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,  The report further stated:   We consider this evidence that [NAOX] and [SZFSG] are not likely to be related.
152,s140,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"  There could, in my opinion, be no more comprehensive proof to the contrary of what was asserted in Question 8 of the letter of 17 October 2007."
153,s141,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,The DNA analysis taken at the initiative of the appellants was done in order to establish that they are not brothers.
154,s142,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"The Tribunal, however, dissected the DNA analysis and focuses on a statement that there was ""inconclusive evidence of a cousins relationship""."
155,s143,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"The Tribunal, quite irrationally and indefensibly in my opinion:   ... finds that the DNA test was designed to provide (inter alia) an index showing evidence of a cousins relationship, limited to first cousins."
156,s144,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"  Further, having regard to a ""dob-in"" claim that the appellants are cousins once removed, the Tribunal said:   ... the Tribunal finds that there is a strong likelihood that the DNA results supports the dob-in information, in the context that the (first) cousins index was 0.63."
157,s145,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"  The treatment by the Tribunal of the information requested by the Tribunal, and the DNA analysis that was supplied in response to that question, which appears at pages 68 to 70 of the Tribunal's reasons, is not only wrong, but, in my judgment, contrived to support a predetermined result."
158,s146,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"There were further invitations sent by fax on 14 December 2007, as well as further invitations on 16 January 2008."

160,s148,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,There was a request for an extension of time.
161,s149,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"The Tribunal responded:   In all the circumstances the Tribunal has considered the request for an extension to respond to the letters dated 16 January 2008 carefully, but have decided not to grant an extension of time for both matters."
162,s150,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"  The response by both appellants, received on 30 January 2008, made the point:   At the outset, we make the point that this tribunal (""the Third Tribunal"") should disqualify itself on the grounds that its conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias."
163,s151,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,The Tribunal is acting in a partisan manner to bring about a particular result.

171,s159,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,    In the context of an application that has been before two previous Tribunals (the decision of the First Tribunal being overturned by the High Court and the decision of the Second Tribunal being overturned by consent by the Full Court of the Federal Court) the Third Tribunal's conduct to date does not look like that of a fair and impartial tribunal of fact.
172,s160,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,Rather it has all the hallmarks of a decision maker attempting to find some justification for a decision it has already decided to make.
173,s161,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"  In the reasons of the third Tribunal, the Tribunal said:   Before proceeding to the findings and reasons, the Tribunal will turn to the requests for the Tribunal to disqualify itself for reasons of bias which are not discussed elsewhere in the decision record."
174,s162,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,The Tribunal is very concerned about claims relating to bias.
175,s163,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"As a result, the Tribunal has carefully considered the issues identified by the applicants' adviser regarding possible apprehended and/or actual bias ...   A fair reading of the third Tribunal's reasons and comments in this respect are highly argumentative and self-justifying."
176,s164,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"In particular, the third Tribunal said:   ... in this case at the hearing before the third Tribunal, the Tribunal became aware of possible inconsistencies between parts of the applicants' evidence, possible internal contradictions in each of the applicant's evidence, and the first applicant's refusal to answer a question."
177,s165,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,These matters raised possible issues of truthfulness and credibility.
178,s166,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,The Tribunal also became aware at the hearing before the third Tribunal of possible inconsistencies and unreliability in the witness' evidence.

181,s169,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"This evidence in my view, indicates that the Tribunal was not concerned with genuine fact finding, but was seeking to give effect to a preordained result."
182,s170,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"In a letter dated 11 July 2007 signed and dated by both appellants, the following offer was made to the Tribunal:   Should you require it (although such a step would cause us significant embarrassment) we are prepared to have an adult witness view us engaged in an act of homosexual intercourse and then attest before you to that fact."
183,s171,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"It would be illogical were you to refuse such an offer and then go on to find, as did Member Hardy, that we are not homosexual."

185,s173,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,The Tribunal asked if they used a lubricant.
186,s174,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,The first applicant stated that he did not wish to answer.
187,s175,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"  The Tribunal said later in its reasons:   The Tribunal, with respect, has difficulty understanding how viewing an act of homosexual intercourse, where a lubricant may or may not be used, is less offensive to the applicants than answering a question as to whether a lubricant is used."
188,s176,NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 (18 September 2009),09_1056.xml,"    Because of the refusal to answer the Tribunal's question, and the lack of a cogent response, the Tribunal finds that the first applicant is not a truthful or credible witness."

37,s31,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"ISSUE 1 --- TIME FOR COMPLIANCE  9 The appellant submits that on a proper construction of the Court Order of 24 August 2005 there was no decision on the strike out application because the expression ""strike out application"" was intended to refer to a decision which disposed of every prayer for relief in the summons and application to strike out heard by the District Court Deputy Registrar."
38,s32,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"This application, it is said, sought additional orders to the strike out, including an application that there be summary judgment against Leonard Cohen amp; Co and that the proceedings be dismissed."
39,s33,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,10 Order 16 of the District Court Rules gives the power to grant summary judgment.
40,s34,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"The language of the Court Order is clear, and it refers specifically to the strike out application and not to the disposition of the application before the Deputy Registrar."
41,s35,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,Separate relief was sought based on two different orders.
42,s36,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,The strike out application was dismissed.
43,s37,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"The strike out application was therefore the subject of ""a decision""."
44,s38,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"There is no reference in the Chamber Summons to the disposition of all relief sought in the summons, including summary judgment and other prayers in the summons."
45,s39,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"On the contrary, the reference was, by consent, limited specifically to the application for a strike out."
46,s40,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"One must assume that when orders of this nature are consented to, careful thought has been given to the precise wording."
47,s41,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"Accordingly, for these reasons, the ""three working days"" as referred to in the Consent Orders, ran from the making of the Court Order dismissing the strike out application on 24 August 2005."
48,s42,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,The fact that there is a reference to the balance of the application being adjourned and costs reserved does not affect this conclusion.
49,s43,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"11 Accordingly, I do not accept the appellant's submission on the first issue."
50,s44,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,ISSUE TWO --- UNDERTAKING  12 The application to strike out was unsuccessful.
51,s45,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,The undertaking given in terms committed the appellant to forthwith pay the amount claimed in the bankruptcy action and to take no further proceedings seeking to set aside the notice.
52,s46,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,This undertaking was enlivened on and after dismissal of the strike out.
53,s47,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"13 It must also be kept in mind that in the judgment under appeal, the learned Magistrate was construing the consent undertaking and not a statutory instrument."
54,s48,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"The undertaking is a consensual document and it is the common intent of the parties in giving and accepting the obligations therein, as reasonably construed in the light of the context, which determines its effect."
55,s49,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,The appellant submits that the undertaking does not cover an opposition to a creditor's petition on the ground that the bankruptcy notice should be set aside.
56,s50,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,It is said that opposition to a sequestration order under s 52 of the Act raises some different considerations to those relevant to an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice under s 40.
57,s51,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,This can be accepted.
58,s52,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"14 However, in the context of this litigation, the Consent Orders were intended to and in terms require the appellant to refrain from any further challenges to the bankruptcy notice in whatever form and at whatever stage such challenge is made."
59,s53,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,The procedure to oppose the petition involves filing a Notice of Opposition and an Affidavit: see O 77 r 11 of the Federal Court (Bankruptcy) Rules .
60,s54,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,The purpose of the undertaking is that no steps will be taken to challenge the notice as a condition of the respondent's agreement to extend the time for compliance until a decision is made on the strike out application.
61,s55,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,There is an inconsistency between an undertaking not to take proceedings to set aside the bankruptcy notice yet to reserve a right to achieve the same result under the discretionary power given in s 52(2).
62,s56,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,The undertaking does not limit the expression 'proceedings' to one under s 40 of the Act .
63,s57,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,It commits the appellant not to take any proceedings which produce the result of effectively setting aside the notice for this reason.
64,s58,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,I do not accept the submission of the appellant on this second issue.
65,s59,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"ISSUE 3 --- S 52 --- SUFFICIENT CAUSE  15 Under s 52(2) of the Act , if the Court is not satisfied with proof of any of the matters specified in the creditor's petition, or is satisfied by the debtor that for other sufficient cause a sequestration order ought not be made, the Court has a discretion to dismiss the petition."
66,s60,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,This discretionary power is broad.
67,s61,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"16 The onus is on the appellant to establish ""sufficient cause""."
68,s62,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,The appellant relies on outstanding costs orders against the respondent which have been made but which have not been taxed.
69,s63,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,The appellant relies on the evidence of a costs expert that the total amount will exceed the debt in the bankruptcy notice.
70,s64,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,17 A similar argument was not successful on the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice before Registrar Tesoriero.
71,s65,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"The respondent refers to judgments and orders for costs untaxed in other proceedings, which are said to exceed the costs referred to by the appellant."
72,s66,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"The potential claim of the appellant for costs is said to be in the order of an amount less than $20,000.00, whereas there is an outstanding judgment in favour of the respondent for $240,512.51 exclusive of costs."
73,s67,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"18 Having regard to the consent undertaking, the judgments referred to in submissions, and the relative costs awards together with the outstanding judgment sum of $240,512.51, the appellant has not satisfied me that there is ""other sufficient cause"" which would warrant dismissal of the petition."
74,s68,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"It is not necessary for me to consider, as a matter of law, whether the undertaking precludes the appellant from raising this issue, but it clearly is an important matter for consideration when contemplating the exercise of the statutory discretion."
75,s69,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,ISSUE 4 --- IDENTITY OF CREDITORS  19 The appellant submits that the bankruptcy notice should be set aside because there is uncertainty as to the identity of the judgment creditor.
76,s70,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,Counsel does not submit that there is any direct evidence from the appellant that he was misled as to the creditor.
77,s71,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,Nor is there any suggestion that the appellant made any attempt to pay the outstanding monies as required by the bankruptcy notice.
78,s72,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"Nevertheless, it is contended by the appellant that the judgment debtor must not be left in any reasonable doubt as to the identity of the judgment creditor."
79,s73,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,20 Counsel for the appellant submits that there was reasonable doubt in this case having regard to the following circumstances.
80,s74,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"The respondent says that the agreements it sues on were on entered into on 21 September 1995 and 1 October 1995, at a time when Mr Leonard Cohen was a sole trader carrying on business under the name ""Leonard Cohen amp; Co."" On 1 November 2005, Messrs Georgiou and Vertannes joined the partnership."
81,s75,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"21 The evidence of Mr Georgiou in an affidavit signed on 17 May 2005 is that it was a term of the partnership agreement that the partnership assumed all rights and obligations of Mr Cohen's existing practice as from 1 November 1995, excluding debtors to whom accounts had been rendered prior to 1 November 1995."
82,s76,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,Mr Georgiou notes that included in the rights and obligations were all the rights and obligations pursuant to the agreement entered into on 21 September 1995 between Leonard Cohen amp; Co and the appellant.
83,s77,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"He states that on 1 November 1995, the respondent further assumed all rights and obligations in relation to the written retainer agreement entered into on that day."
84,s78,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"On 8 December 1995, a Statement of Change in Registered Particulars was registered reflecting the change as to owners of the business name."
85,s79,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"22 The work which is the subject of the relevant claim was carried out by the firm from September 1995 and ceased in February 1998, when instructions were withdrawn."
86,s80,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"When the first writ was issued on 17 March 2000, the three above named persons traded as ""Leonard Cohen amp; Co."" The writ in respect of which the relevant costs order was made was issued when Messrs Georgiou and Vertannes owned the company name."
87,s81,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"23 On 30 June 2003, Mr Cohen ceased to be a co-proprietor of the business name, but there is evidence that the partnership with Messrs Georgiou and Vertannes was continued for limited purposes, presumably in order to wind up all the affairs of the partnership, including collection of all debts."
88,s82,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"24 The appellant says that there was reasonable doubt in his mind as to the identity of the creditor, and that therefore the notice is a nullity."
89,s83,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,The question is whether a reasonable person in the position of the appellant would have been misled.
90,s84,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"25 It is common ground that a firm can bring bankruptcy proceedings in the firm name under s 307 of the Act , and that a change in the composition of the firm does not invalidate the bankruptcy notice: Anderson Rice v Bride (1995) 61 FCR 529 and 542."
91,s85,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"The Full Court in Anderson Rice noted that it is the duty of the debtor to seek out and to pay the judgment creditor, if the creditor is in Australia: James v Federal Commissioner for Taxation [1955] HCA 75 ; (1955) 93 CLR 631 at 639."
92,s86,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,This reasoning is applicable in the present case.
93,s87,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"26 I am not persuaded that there was any basis on which it could be established that the appellant had any reasonable ground to doubt that those parties constituting the firm under the name Leonard Cohen amp; Co obtained the rights to remuneration and obligations in respect of work during September 1995 through February 1998, or that they were the proprietors of the firm entitled to recover the fees."
94,s88,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"At all relevant times in this period, the partnership was constituted by Mr Cohen and as from 1 November 2005, with retrospective effect, the firm included Messrs Cohen, Georgiou and Vertannes."
95,s89,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"27 I note that the bankruptcy notice of 13 January 2005 referred to ""Leonard Cohen amp; Co"" and gave the address of that firm."
96,s90,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"It also stated that payment could be made to Stewart Forbes, Barrister and Solicitor at 16 Irwin Street, Perth and the evidence indicates that no attempt was made to proffer any such payment."
97,s91,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"The Notice also specifies that Mr Forbes, who issued the notice, was the agent of the creditors."
98,s92,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"28 The evidence does not establish that the appellant was misled as to the persons to whom he should pay the debt, nor that he had any reasonable doubt as to when the work was done or that such work included work up to February 1998."
99,s93,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,He could have made payment to Stewart Forbes and this would have satisfied the Notice.
100,s94,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,Accounting between the parties as to the allocation of the payment was a matter for them.
101,s95,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,"29 This case is in no way comparable the facts in McWilliam v Jackson [2000] FCA 175 ; (2000) 96 FCR 561 where the creditor was identified in the notice as ""Anthony Jackson amp; Others."
102,s96,Paligorov v Cohen [2006] FCA 1473 (10 November 2006),06_1473.xml,""" The reference to ""others"" in that case was open-ended and uncertain on its face."

8,s1,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"On 4 September 2008, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT) affirmed a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) of 23 November 2007."
9,s2,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,The SSAT found that the decision of the authorised review officer of Centrelink of 27 September 2007 to cancel Mr Zoia's Newstart allowance from 24 July 2007 was correct.
10,s3,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,The AAT affirmed that decision.

12,s5,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,The AAT declined that application for an adjournment on the basis that it had a duty to make a decision.
13,s6,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,The relevant issues before the AAT were: Section 605(2) and (3) of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) (the SS Act) provides that the Secretary can require a person who has entered into a Newstart Activity Agreement to enter a new agreement by giving a person notice of the requirement and the place and time the agreement is to be negotiated.
14,s7,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,Such notices were sent to Mr Zoia.

16,s9,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,He was also warned of the consequences of failing to sign the Agreement but declined to do so.
17,s10,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,The AAT concluded that Mr Zoia by his own admissions made at the AAT acknowledged that he had no reasonable excuse pursuant to s 626 of the SS Act for not entering into the Newstart Activity Agreement.
18,s11,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,At the heart of Mr Zoia's appeal as best one can discern it is the argument that his Newstart allowance should not have been cancelled as there was no power to compel him to sign the new Newstart Activity Agreement.
19,s12,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"APPLICATIONS TO ADJOURN  Shortly prior to the hearing of this appeal on 5 August 2009, Mr Zoia wrote to the Western Australia District Registry of this Court requesting an opportunity to read the transcript of a hearing to which the reasons in Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 661 relate."
20,s13,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,On the occasion of that hearing (which was to be the hearing of the appeal) it had been necessary to adjourn the substantive hearing of the appeal in order to consider Mr Zoia's argument that the appeal was a nullity.
21,s14,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"While the discussion which ensued at that hearing could have no possible bearing on the substantive appeal, the starting time of the appeal was nevertheless deferred to permit Mr Zoia the opportunity to read the transcript."
22,s15,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,At the re-listed hearing of the appeal on 5 August 2009 Mr Zoia sought to re-agitate the issues dealt with in that interlocutory hearing.
23,s16,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,I did not permit that course.
24,s17,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,Mr Zoia sought a further adjournment of the hearing of the appeal on two grounds.
25,s18,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,The respondent opposed the application.
26,s19,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,The first ground was that he has sought access to a transcript of a directions hearing in which orders had been made pursuant to O 53 of the Federal Court Rules dealing with the procedural aspects of the appeal.
27,s20,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"In particular, he complained that he did not know what was involved in the settling of an appeal book index."
28,s21,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"To the extent that access to that transcript was required, it would inevitably have occasioned an adjournment because no transcript had been produced."
29,s22,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,I will assume that there is a recording in existence of that directions hearing which was conducted in October 2008.
30,s23,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,A further adjournment would not have been in the interests of justice.
31,s24,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,Mr Zoia apparently did not attend on the adjourned appointment for the settling of his appeal book index.
32,s25,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"I was informed by counsel for the respondent, and accept, that in light of his non-attendance, the respondent ensured that all of the material that had been before the AAT was made available in the appeal book for this hearing."
33,s26,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"In those circumstances, Mr Zoia was unable to identify and I was unable to discern any prejudice which would have been occasioned to him by proceeding with the hearing of the appeal."
34,s27,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"I also note, as submitted by counsel for the respondent, that Mr Zoia is no stranger to litigation and, in particular, has previously been involved in at least one appeal from the AAT and has some familiarity with the process."
35,s28,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,The second ground on which Mr Zoia sought an adjournment was in order to obtain legal advice.
36,s29,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,I accept Mr Zoia's argument that he is not well versed in the law.
37,s30,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,But I also concluded that the interests of justice did not support the granting of a further adjournment for the following grounds and I declined to permit it.
38,s31,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,Mr Zoia made a further application for legal assistance to the Attorney-General's Department which was rejected in March this year on the basis that the view was formed that his appeal did not appear to have sufficient prospects of success.
39,s32,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"As late as July this year following the adjournment of the first return date for the hearing of the appeal (too late in my opinion) he pursued a further application knowing, however, that the matter was listed for hearing on 5 August 2009."
40,s33,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"There is little reason to think that that late application would have met with success, that is to say, that the Attorney-General would have formed a contrary view to that expressed some months ago as to the prospects of success of the appeal."
41,s34,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,Steps were taken last year to endeavour to find a pro bono legal practitioner to advise Mr Zoia in relation to his appeal.
42,s35,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,Those steps were unsuccessful.
43,s36,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"As will be evident from the reasons which follow, the grounds of appeal on their face are barely intelligible and Mr Zoia's argument in support of them which has been raised at previous interlocutory hearings is equally lacking in clarity."
44,s37,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"On the other hand, Mr Zoia has raised similar points to those which he seemingly wishes to raise in this appeal in an appeal which is the subject of a decision by Siopis J in Zoia v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 988."
45,s38,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,Mr Zoia was self-represented and argued that appeal himself apparently with sufficient ability to at least convey to his Honour part of the nature of his complaint.
46,s39,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"His Honour having ruled against him on that complaint already, it is not particularly surprising that Mr Zoia's attempts to obtain legal assistance have not met with success."
47,s40,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"On the basis therefore of delay in bringing the oral application, or the repetition of earlier argument which had been rejected and that a reasonable opportunity had been given already to attempt to obtain legal representation, the request for a further adjournment for that purpose was declined."
48,s41,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,The appeal therefore proceeded.
49,s42,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"On a number of occasions in the course of argument on the appeal, Mr Zoia indicated that he would like leave to appeal to the High Court to ventilate both the need for legal counsel and certain constitutional arguments."
50,s43,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,"I made it clear to Mr Zoia that if his appeal before me was unsuccessful, he would have the opportunity to appeal to the Full Federal Court and a further opportunity from there if he was unsuccessful again, to seek leave to appeal to the High Court."
51,s44,"Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2009] FCA 924 (21 August 2009)",09_924.xml,It was made clear to Mr Zoia that it was not within my power to grant him leave to appeal to the High Court.
